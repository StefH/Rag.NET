/// This is the first multi-container fixture in the repo — every other one is a single
/// container and there is no <c>docker-compose</c> anywhere. It needs two: the emulator itself
/// stores its state in SQL, so an Azure SQL Edge container joins it on a shared
/// <see cref="INetwork"/> under a fixed alias the emulator resolves via <c>SQL_SERVER</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Entities are declared up front in a mounted <c>Config.json</c> because the emulator has no
/// management plane: there is no <c>ServiceBusAdministrationClient</c> to create a queue at
/// runtime, so anything a test wants must exist before the container starts. The file is
/// supplied through <c>WithResourceMapping</c> rather than a bind mount, which keeps the
/// fixture from writing to the developer's filesystem.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The connection string is the local-emulator form: <c>UseDevelopmentEmulator=true</c> with
/// the mapped AMQP port, which tells the SDK to skip TLS and the usual SAS handshake.

    // LockDuration is PT5M, raised from PT1M for #246 on the theory that a loaded runner let locks
    // expire before a test settled its message.
    //
    // THAT THEORY IS DISPROVEN AND THIS VALUE IS NOT THE FIX. Instrumenting the failing call showed
    // the lock carrying its FULL 300 SECONDS at the moment it was rejected, on every observed run
    // including the CI capture of 2026-09-14 — where the settle came 3.4 ms after the lock was
    // taken, at deliveryCount 1. A lock with five minutes left has not expired, so expiry was never
    // the mechanism and neither PT1M nor PT5M was ever load-bearing. #246 was closed as completed
    // by this change and stayed closed for a month while still failing; it is open again.
    //
    // The value is left at PT5M rather than reverted. It is harmless — far beyond any of these
    // tests' Bound, so a real hang still fails on the timeout rather than being masked — and
    // changing it now would be a third guess at a mechanism that is still unknown. What is under
    // investigation is recorded on #246 and instrumented in ServiceBusIngestionIntegrationTests.
