/// Both directions are pinned because they are different problems: normalization GROWS CJK text (a
/// space inserted either side of every ideograph) and SHRINKS NFD-decomposed text (combining marks
/// stripped). The message has to say which, so a reader can tell a Japanese corpus from a
/// macOS-normalized filename.

/// The two figures quoted here are THIS file's own fixtures, and the real-tokenizer cases assert

/// shrinks 10 → 9. The 14 → 11 this remark used to quote for the NFD direction is a real
