/// One end-to-end pass of <c>Rag.NET.Raptor</c> over a list of MultiHop-RAG articles: ingest, then
/// build the RAPTOR tree — the RAPTOR equivalent of <see cref="GraphRagRun"/>.
/// <para>
/// <b>Under <see cref="RaptorTreeScope.Corpus"/>, ingestion never goes through
/// <see cref="RaptorIngestionBehavior.HandleAsync"/> at all.</b> The obvious fix — leave the
/// behaviour's growth-threshold debounce suppressed via
/// <see cref="RaptorOptions.CorpusGrowthThreshold"/> — does not actually suppress it for a bulk
/// load. The debounce's baseline resets to whatever the corpus held at the last build, so after
/// document 0 (roughly 29 chunks) the next build fires once the corpus reaches roughly 101 x 29
/// &#8776; 2,929 leaves — around article 101 of 609, not "never". Worse, that trigger point is
/// <i>order dependent</i>: MultiHop-RAG has an article with 201 chunks, and if it happens to land
/// first, 101 x 201 already exceeds the whole corpus and no second build ever fires. A measurement
/// harness cannot have a hidden variable of that shape — the tree it measures would depend on
/// document order.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So this class does not tune the debounce; it bypasses the path that reads it. Under
/// <see cref="RaptorTreeScope.Corpus"/>, each document's chunks are embedded, written straight to
/// the leaf store (<see cref="Store.IRaptorLeafStore.AddLeavesAsync"/>) and the vector store, and
/// nothing else — <see cref="RaptorIngestionBehavior"/> is never asked to ingest. This loses no
/// fidelity: every summary <see cref="RaptorIngestionBehavior.HandleAsync"/> could have produced
/// mid-ingestion is filed under <see cref="RaptorCorpusDocumentId.Value"/>, and
/// <see cref="RaptorTreeRebuilder.RebuildAsync"/> opens by deleting exactly that id before writing
/// the tree it built — so any such summary would have been discarded before anything measured it.
/// The single call to <see cref="RaptorTreeRebuilder.RebuildAsync"/>, made once ingestion finishes,
/// is the only tree this class ever produces under <see cref="RaptorTreeScope.Corpus"/>, and it is
/// now the only one <i>possible</i> — not merely the only one intended.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Under <see cref="RaptorTreeScope.PerDocument"/>, ingestion goes through
/// <see cref="RaptorIngestionBehavior.HandleAsync"/> unchanged.</b> There the ingestion path is
/// what builds the tree — each document's own chunks are clustered into their own tree as that
/// document is ingested — so bypassing it would leave nothing to measure.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The embedder is an interface, not the concrete <c>OnnxEmbeddingGenerator</c> the design
/// sketched.</b> <c>OnnxEmbeddingGenerator</c>'s public constructor loads a real ONNX model and
/// vocabulary file from disk, and <see cref="GraphRagRun"/>'s own equivalent is exercised only by
/// tests that already require those files. This class's behaviour needs covering by a test with no
/// model and no corpus — so the parameter is <see cref="IEmbeddingGenerator{TInput,TEmbedding}"/>,
/// which the real <c>OnnxEmbeddingGenerator</c> implements just as well as a fake does. Nothing

/// <see cref="GraphRagSliceIngestion.ChunkAsync"/> is <see cref="RecursiveChunkingStrategy"/> at
