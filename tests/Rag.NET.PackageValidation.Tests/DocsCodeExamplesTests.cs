/// from the produced <c>.nupkg</c> files — never the working tree, never assembly loading. See
/// that class's remarks for the extraction rule stated precisely, including the two leniencies
/// docs need that a README rarely does (locally-declared example types; string-literal
/// blanking) and the one shape disabled for docs only (a lowercase-local member chain), and what
/// is deliberately left unchecked regardless.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>What differs from the README case.</b> A package README may only use what that package
/// ships (plus its dependency closure), so <see cref="PackageReadmeTests"/> resolves each README
/// against its own package's closure. A docs page can legitimately use anything the project
/// ships — <c>docs/getting-started.md</c> alone spans <c>Rag.NET</c>,
/// <c>Rag.NET.VectorStores.PgVector</c>, and <c>Rag.NET.Parsers.Pdf</c> in one walkthrough — so
/// this class resolves every fence against <em>every</em> produced package's surface at once, via
/// <see cref="ApiSurfaceCatalog.BuildCatalogFromPackages"/> given the whole discovered set rather
/// than one package's closure. There is no must-touch-its-own-API requirement here, because there
/// is no single "its own" package for a docs page to belong to.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The allow-list.</b> Even a full transitive dependency closure and locally-declared-type
/// leniency leave a handful of references that are correct code the resolvable set will never
/// contain on principle: a package a consumer adds themselves that no produced package depends on

/// type in a provider-agnostic example, mirroring how getting-started.md itself has the reader
/// add <c>Microsoft.Extensions.AI.OpenAI</c>). Each is named in
/// <see cref="AllowedExternalReferences"/> with its reason, following the
/// <c>PackagesAllowedToDeclareNone</c> precedent in <c>PackageVerificationTests</c>: a listed
/// reference is skipped by the main gate, and
/// <see cref="EveryAllowedExternalReferenceStillFails"/> independently re-derives the raw failure
/// set and fails the moment a listed entry stops appearing in it — resolved because the catalog
/// widened, or because the docs changed — so a stale entry cannot sit unnoticed. Keeping the list

/// guard shipped with, found in issue #194 and both the same mistake — deciding what to check by
/// where a file sits rather than by who reads it:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><c>.mdx</c> was excluded by extension alone. The walk asked for <c>*.md</c>, so

/// <item>The root <c>README.md</c> was checked by nothing at all, and uniquely so:

/// <see cref="PackageReadmeTests.EveryPackageShipsItsOwnReadme"/> <em>forbids</em> a package
/// shipping the root one, so no package ever carries it into that guard's reach; and this class

/// <b>The covered set is itself asserted.</b> Widening the walk closes the two holes #194 found;
/// it does nothing about the third one nobody has opened yet, because until now no test said
/// which files were supposed to be checked — a walk that quietly narrows goes green exactly as
/// convincingly as a walk that covers everything, which is how both holes survived every review
/// this guard has had. <see cref="EveryPublishedDocumentationFileIsCheckedBySomething"/> states
/// the covered set as a fact and fails on anything outside it, deriving "ought to be checked"
/// from a deliberately wider markdown-family extension list than the walk's own, so the two
/// cannot agree with each other by construction.

/// <para>
/// Discovery and skip behaviour are shared with <see cref="ProducedPackageTests"/>: no

/// <para>
/// <b>What this does not catch, demonstrated rather than theorised.</b> Resolution is by
/// <i>name</i>: a member reference passes when something in the shipped surface declares that

/// a catalogue. So <c>response.Text</c> passed for months in <c>docs/guide/memory.md</c> —
/// <c>IRagPipeline.AskAsync</c> returns <see cref="Rag.NET.Models.RagResponse"/>, whose property
/// is <c>Answer</c>, but <c>Text</c> exists on <c>TextChunk</c> and <c>DocumentSection</c>, so the
/// name resolved and the snippet still would not compile. It was found by a user in issue #56,
/// after this guard had already run green over that exact file.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The honest summary is that this catches <i>names that exist nowhere</i> — a renamed or deleted
/// API, a package id used as a namespace, a method invented for a tutorial — and not <i>names on

/// a different and much larger tool.
/// </para>

/// <b>That gap is not hypothetical, and the count is now known.</b> This paragraph used to end
/// "it is worth building only if wrong-type references turn out to be common, and one instance is
/// not evidence of that". They turned out to be common. Widening the walk for #194 was paired
/// with an audit of every live page against the current API, and it found <b>ten</b> snippets
/// that name only real members and still would not compile — the one <c>response.Text</c> above
/// (issue #56's defect, fixed in <c>docs/guide/memory.md</c> and never on the front page: #193),
/// and nine sites where the <c>IDictionary&lt;string, string&gt;</c> →
/// <c>IDictionary&lt;string, MetadataValue&gt;</c> migration stopped short (#192). Every one of
/// the nine writes <c>new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;</c> into a <c>Tags</c> or
/// <c>MetadataFilter</c> that is now typed on <see cref="Rag.NET.Models.MetadataValue"/>. Nothing
/// in the shape scan can see it: <c>Dictionary</c> is a real type, <c>Tags</c> and
/// <c>MetadataFilter</c> are real members, and the generic arguments are the keyword
/// <c>string</c>, which the extractor skips as not-PascalCase. So the guard reads the fence,
/// resolves every name in it, and passes — which is why the migration could stall in nine
/// published places without one red run.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why type checking is still not built here, stated as a decision rather than an
