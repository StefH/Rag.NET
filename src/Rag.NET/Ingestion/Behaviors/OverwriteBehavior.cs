/// Those three stores are the whole of it. <see cref="IParentChunkStore"/> is deliberately not
/// touched here — it is not even injected — so parent chunks written by a previous ingest survive
/// an overwrite. They are upserted on <c>(documentId, parentChunkIndex)</c> rather than appended,
/// so this is stale-tail behaviour rather than duplication, and it matches the vector store's.
/// Only <see cref="IIngestor.DeleteAsync"/> purges parent chunks. Adding the purge here would
/// change what <c>Overwrite</c> means for every existing caller, so it is recorded, not done.

/// <para>
/// This is not what makes re-ingest a replace — <see cref="StorageBehavior"/> is, and it removes
/// the append-only entries unconditionally right before re-adding them. What remains here is the
/// stronger, opt-in guarantee: those three stores are cleared up front regardless of what happens
/// next, so an overwrite whose new content fails to parse or yields no chunks still leaves nothing
/// of them behind. The two BM25/data-manager removals therefore overlap on the happy path
/// (removal is idempotent) and differ only on those paths, which is the behaviour <c>Overwrite</c>
/// already had.
