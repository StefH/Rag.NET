/// Hybrid search. When the registered store implements <see cref="IHybridSearchable"/> and the
/// request configures nothing the native call cannot express (see
/// <see cref="CanDispatchNatively"/>), the store's own server-side hybrid query serves the
/// request in a single backend call. Otherwise dense vector search is fused client-side with
/// BM25 and — when an <see cref="ISparseEmbeddingGenerator"/> is registered and the store
/// implements <see cref="ISparseSearchable"/> — a learned sparse (SPLADE) arm, all merged by
/// weighted Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Which path served a query is observable: the
/// <c>ragnet.retrieve</c> activity gains a <c>retrieval.hybrid.path</c> tag (<c>native</c> or
/// <c>client</c>), and the native path logs <c>ensemble_native_hybrid</c> naming the store.
/// The client path is degraded, never broken: a failed BM25 or sparse arm is logged and the
/// remaining arms are fused; dense-only results are returned when both fail. The native path
/// has no fallback — a failed native hybrid call throws, like a failed dense search.
