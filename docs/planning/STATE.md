# Session State

**Last updated:** 2026-09-16 — **the documentation site was publishing half of itself, and the
half it published pointed at packages that do not exist.** Four PRs (#647, #648, #649, #652), all
merged or green, each carrying a guard on `ci.yml`.

**THE COMMON CAUSE: a green docs build is not evidence of anything the sweep found.** Docusaurus
routes a page whether or not a sidebar names it, resolves nothing about a package id sitting in
prose, and has no opinion about a hand-maintained table of contents. `docs.yml` is also
path-filtered, so a rename from a `src/`-only branch never runs it at all. Every defect below was
therefore invisible to the one check that runs on documentation changes, and stayed invisible
across a released 1.0.0.

| What was wrong | Size | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| Pages in no sidebar — published, live, unbrowsable | 13 of 34 pages, 4,751 of 17,500 lines | `DocumentationSidebarTests` |
| Landing-page catalogue naming retired packages | 8 ids `dotnet add package` cannot resolve | `DocumentationPackageReferenceTests` |
| …and omitting real ones | 39 of 73 packages | same |
| Front-page Pages table | 18 of 36 pages listed | `DocumentationIndexTests` |
| Builder calls with prose only in the backlog | 11 of 112 | — (read, not guarded) |

`guide/raptor` and `guide/graphrag` had **no inbound link from any listed page**, so browsing
could not reach them by any route. The RAPTOR guide is 461 lines covering tree scope, all three
retrieval modes and the corpus-store limitations, and nothing on the site pointed at it.

**THE GUARD DESIGN THAT ALMOST WENT WRONG, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT STOPPED IT.** The obvious
check for a stale package reference is "does this `Rag.NET.*` token resolve to something under
`src/`". **It catches none of the eight.** The decomposition retired the package ids and kept the
namespaces: the type inside `Rag.NET.Parsers.Office` is still declared in `namespace
Rag.NET.Parsers.Word`, so every retired id is still a real namespace. Checked before choosing the
design rather than after it shipped green and useless. The guard keys on *position* instead — an
install command, a table cell under a package column, an oss-libraries `**Used in:**` line — and
leaves prose alone, where the same token usually does mean the namespace.

**ONE LIVE BUG FELL OUT OF READING THE PAGES.** `retrieval.md` told readers to reach Cohere
reranking through `UseReranking<CohereReranker>()`. That throws at resolve time: the generic
overload registers the type and not its options, and `CohereReranker`'s constructor requires a
`CohereRerankerOptions` with a non-empty `ApiKey`. `UseCohereReranking` registers the options and
then makes the same generic call itself.

**`docs/reference/features.md` stopped publishing** (#652). It is titled "Feature Backlog" and
reads like one, and it sat in Reference beside the guide — the only page a newcomer could mistake
for a feature list was the one written for maintainers. Excluded from the build, **not moved**:
three test files and this file's own history name the path, and a log is not text to rewrite
because a file moved.

**The exclusion list is now read, never restated.** The first package guard carried its own copy
of the excluded directories with a comment arguing the set was "small and stable enough" to
duplicate. That held for one week. All three guards now read `docusaurus.config.ts` through
`PublishedDocumentation`.

**Carry the method:** every guard here was exercised against the defect it exists for *before*
being relied on — a page dropped from the sidebar, an id misspelled, all five package-citation
shapes, a row removed from the Pages table, and a page excluded from the site to confirm the guard
stops demanding a row rather than demanding one for an unreachable page. A guard that has never
been seen to fail is a guard nobody has tested.

**`pack-validate` caught what local runs did not.** `DocsCodeExamplesTests` resolves every C#
fence under `docs/` against the produced `.nupkg` files, and it is unreachable from `dotnet build`.
It failed #649 on three placeholder types the new examples named but never declared. Declaring
them surfaced a fourth error — an invented `DocumentOcrResult` constructor. Run it before pushing
docs that add a code fence, after a clean `dotnet pack`; stale packages in `artifacts/packages`
also break `ExactlyTheShippableSetIsPacked`, which expects exactly 73.

---

**Previously:** **v1.0.0 IS RELEASED.** Tagged `v1.0.0` at `a658cd6e`, 73 packages
and 73 symbol packages live on nuget.org via Trusted Publishing, verified against nuget.org's own
flat-container index rather than the workflow's green check. Milestone 6 criterion 8 is discharged.

**THE LAST FIX BEFORE THE RELEASE WAS DIAGNOSED WRONG BY ME, AND CAUGHT BY MEASURING PROPERLY.**
#640 — concurrent SQLite writers threw `database is locked` after 31.5 seconds on `windows-latest`
against a five-minute `LockDuration`. The root cause is that **`busy_timeout` defaults to 0**: SQLite
returned `SQLITE_BUSY` instantly and `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`'s command-level retry loop spun above it
for 30 seconds. The writers were never queueing. That is why "the lock expired" never fit the
evidence and why the issue was misdiagnosed twice before.

**I then reached for WAL, measured a 53% improvement, and was one commit from shipping it.** That
measurement timed wall clock **including the rebuild** and changed **two pragmas on one line**, so it
credited WAL with a gain that came entirely from the `busy_timeout` bundled beside it. Isolating
them, five runs each with the build outside the timing, median:

| configuration | median |
|---|---|
| neither | 2.77s |
| `busy_timeout` only | **1.03s** |
| WAL only | 3.30s |
| WAL + `busy_timeout` | 1.70s |

**WAL alone is worse than changing nothing here, and it degrades the real fix.** Every store in
`Rag.NET.Storage.Sqlite` opens a fresh unpooled connection per operation, so WAL pays per-connection
setup on every call and never holds a connection long enough to collect its benefit. Shipped in #641
as the one-line pragma, with three mutation-verified guards — one of which **asserts WAL's absence**,
so the next person who reaches for the obvious fix meets the measurement first.

**Carry the method, not just the result.** Two separate false conclusions this session came from the
same shape: a wall-clock number that included build time, and two changes measured as one. The
memory note *performance numbers need two runs* was written for a page-cache artefact and did not
fire here, because the confound was bundling, not caching. Change one thing; put the build outside
the timing; state the median of five.

**Before that:** **Milestone 6 audited: 6 of 8 criteria. The recordings gate is
discharged, and v1.0 no longer waits on accounts.**

**THE GATE THAT HELD SINCE 2026-08-20 IS GONE, AND THE DoD ALWAYS ALLOWED IT.** Criterion 5 asks for
a recording **or** a `VerifiedByReason` — *"so the gap is visible per package instead of blocking the
release on credentials that may never arrive."* Seventeen live-service packages had **neither**: they
sat on `PackagesAllowedToStayUnit` holding an IOU naming the phase that owed them a real run. **An
allowlist entry and a stated reason are not the same thing** — the entry says someone owes work and
keeps the suite green while nobody does it; the reason says, in the package that ships, what a
consumer is and is not getting. #631 wrote seventeen reasons, each for its own position rather than
shared, and emptied the list. 6.1 is complete by reason; **#283 stays open for anyone with an
account.**

**A SHIPPED AUTH DEFECT, FOUND BY ASKING WHETHER CRAG WAS EVER TESTED.** `WebSearch.Tavily` sent the
key as an `api_key` body field Tavily deprecated, with **no Authorization header at all**, and every
test passed. The cassette was **hand-written by whoever wrote the parser** and its matcher keyed on
path and method, so **no test in the repository could observe a credential**. A unit test actively
*pinned* the defect — asserting `r.ApiKey == "my-api-key"` — so a correct fix would have gone red
and read as a regression. #625, fixed in #626, cassette now refuses a request without the Bearer
header, mutation-verified.

**THE CASSETTE AUDIT: 38 OF 41 ARE HAND-WRITTEN.** Only GitHub's three are recordings — real GUIDs,
WireMock's own proxy-recorder naming, and **the only three whose matcher examines `Headers`**. The
other 38, across 13 providers, key on path and method alone. Tavily was not unlucky; it was where the
defect happened to land in a blind spot every cassette shares. Every other provider's auth was
checked and is correct — Notion does send `Notion-Version`, Linear's schemeless header is right for
its personal keys.

**MILESTONE 6 AUDIT — FAIL ON FOUR, NONE BLOCKED ON AN ACCOUNT.** `docs/plans/2026-09-15-milestone-6-audit.md`.
Two resolved by decision: 6.1 complete by reason, 6.2 complete because `substantially complete` is
not a status any audit can key on. Two opened as phases — **6.2.44** for the 29 features claiming
Done while naming nothing that exercises them, **6.2.45** for the last bare `unit`. Numbered as
sub-phases so 6.3 keeps the number release notes point at.

**AND THE DoD CONTRADICTED THE CONVENTIONS.** Criterion 8 said *"Release tagged v1.0"* while
`CONVENTIONS.md` says `Released by: release-please` and `Milestone completion tags a release: no` —
so `complete-milestone` correctly tags nothing and the criterion could only be met by hand-tagging,
the one thing the conventions forbid. Restated against the release-please run.

**THE DOCS SITE IS LIVE** at https://marcelroozekrans.github.io/Rag.NET/ (#628). Retargeting it found
**four** links pointing at the empty `rag-net` org, not two: `editUrl` and the navbar/footer GitHub
buttons rendered a 404 on **every page**, silently. It would also have published nine internal
planning pages — ROADMAP, STATE, CONVENTIONS and five milestone backlogs — as product documentation;
`plans/**` was excluded and `planning/**` was not.

**A GUARD THAT PASSES IS NOT EVIDENCE THE PROPERTY HOLDS — THREE TIMES IN ONE DAY.** Cassette matchers
that could not see a credential. An allowlist emptied into a test that had to be mutation-checked
before it could be trusted. And `FeatureClaimSymbolTests`, which enforces that a Done feature names a
**symbol that ships** — adjacent to criterion 3, not the same, so it passes while the criterion
fails. 6.2.44 extends it rather than just filling in 29 lines.

**Open:** #283 account-blocked, #246 reopened, #615's successor work, and phases 6.2.44 / 6.2.45.
Milestone 6 stands at **6 of 8**.

**Previously, 2026-09-14 — #618 and #617 merged. #615 closed: gleaning earns its call.**

**GLEANING WAS MEASURED AND THE DEFAULT STANDS.** #153 priced the second model call per chunk at
**66.8% of ingestion's input tokens**; nothing had ever measured the other side. Replayed from the
extraction cache at **no spend** — 60 articles, 2,044 chunks, 4,088 calls, **100% cache hit rate** —
it adds **20.2% more entities and 35.8% more relationships net of repeats**. Those tokens are
**bought, not wasted**, which also completes #153's reasoning: `GleaningPasses = 0` saves two-thirds
of ingestion and costs a third of the graph's relationships.

**THE DEDUPLICATION CHECK MOVED THE ANSWER BY A FIFTH.** `PerformGleaningAsync` appends the gleaned
lists **without deduplicating**, so a model restating itself scores as an addition — and **18.7% of
gleaned relationships** name a pair the first pass already returned. The raw lift is +44.0%. **When
a delta is measured by counting what a second call returns, check how much of it is a repeat.**

**A TEST THAT WAS CONFIDENTLY WRONG, AND THE ASSERTION THAT CAUGHT IT.** The first version rebuilt
both prompts from `GraphRagOptions` and looked them up directly. It hit **0%** — the cache keys on
`GraphExtractionPrompt.Render` of the **message list**, which prefixes the role — and printed a
well-formatted table reading *"gleaning added 0 entities, 0.0% lift"*. **A broken replay and a true
finding of zero are indistinguishable in the output.** The hit rate is now asserted at 80%, not
merely printed. Without it the measurement would have argued for deleting a call that earns its keep.

**AND THE FIX EXISTED ALREADY.** `GraphExtractionPlanProbe` drives the real ingestion path through a
recording `IChatClient`, three directories away, and was found only after guessing once at the
mismatch. **Look for the existing probe before reconstructing a prompt, a key, or a protocol.**

**RECORDED, NOT FILED: 577 of 2,044 gleaning calls — 28.2% — returned nothing.** A quarter of the
second calls are pure cost, nothing obviously predicts which, and there is no evidence it is
predictable. Filing it would be recording a hunch as work. The number is on #615 for whoever next has
a reason to look.

**Open:** **#283** account-blocked, **#246** reopened and waiting for a second occurrence, and
Milestone 6's two account-blocked phases. Three Renovate PRs — #585, #579, #562 — are the only
routine maintenance outstanding.

**Previously, 2026-09-14 — #616 merged. #246 REOPENED: it had been closed as completed for a
month while still failing.**

**#246 WAS NEVER OPEN TODAY, AND THIS FILE SAID IT WAS — IN FOUR PLACES.** It was closed as
*completed* on 2026-08-16, **the day it was raised**, by the `PT5M` fix. Its own next comment says
*"My PT5M fix did not work, and the evidence says it addressed the wrong mechanism."* It stayed
closed regardless, through a month of failures, and through today's capture on the #605 build. Now
reopened.

**WHAT KEPT IT CLOSED WAS ONE GREEN RUN.** The 2026-08-17 comment reads *"the next ubuntu run was
green"*. For a failure that reproduces about once in a dozen runs, **a single green run is the
expected outcome whether or not anything was fixed** — the same lesson this file already records for
performance numbers, applied to a flake instead of a benchmark. **Never close an intermittent on one
passing run.**

**AND CHECK ISSUE STATE BEFORE QUOTING IT.** "#246 is still open" was carried through this session
and written into this file repeatedly without once being checked. `gh issue view` costs a second.

**Previously, 2026-09-14 — #614 merged. #153 closed on a measurement that overturned its own
reasoning, and #615 filed on the better question it surfaced.**

**EVERY ISSUE THAT WAS "OPEN AND NOT MINE TO CHOOSE" IS NOW CLOSED** — #184, #175, #153. What
remains open is #246, #283, #607's successor work in #615, and the two account-blocked phases.

**#153 SAID NO, AND ITS OWN REASON FOR SAYING NO WAS WRONG.** It argued the saving lands on the
smallest prompt path because "retrieved chunk text dominates". Measured over 400 real chunks and 400
real extraction payloads with `cl100k_base`: in the **gleaning** prompt the serialised state is
**196 tokens against the chunk's 114** — the larger half, 50.8%. That claim is true of the **answer**
prompt and was carried across to a different one. **If TOON is ever revisited, revisit it knowing
this call site is state-dominated, not text-dominated.**

**THE NUMBERS, AND THE DENOMINATOR THAT MATTERS.** At TOON's own claimed 42.6% the saving is 21.6% of
the gleaning prompt but only **14.5% of the 578 tokens ingestion spends per chunk**, because
`GleaningPasses = 1` sends **two** prompts and the first carries no state. Judging against the
gleaning prompt alone flatters it by half. `GleaningPasses = 0` saves **66.8%** — **4.6x** — for a
config change. **Not dominance and not presented as such**: dropping gleaning changes what gets
extracted, while a format change does not.

**WHICH IS #615: GLEANING IS TWO-THIRDS OF INGESTION'S PROMPT TOKENS AND NOBODY HAS MEASURED WHAT IT
ADDS.** No test or run separates entities found by the initial extraction from those the second call
adds. The default doubles ingestion spend on an unquantified benefit. **#121 is why that needs care
rather than a quick check** — this path once produced zero entities for the package's entire life
without a test failing, and "does the graph still have entities" is exactly the assertion that missed
it. Most of it is replayable from the extraction cache without new spend.

**MEASURE THE CEILING BEFORE BUILDING THE THING.** The whole of #153 was settled without writing a
TOON encoder, by asking what fraction of the prompt could even shrink. A throwaway `dotnet run`
file-based app, the repo's own tokenizer, real corpus and real cache. **Not committed** — the issue
comment carries everything needed to re-run it.

**Previously, 2026-09-14 — at the merge.** #613 and #612 merged, **#607 closed: the embedding
cache is re-keyed on the model revision.**

**THE RE-KEY WAS THE OPERATOR'S CALL, AND THE COST TURNED OUT SMALLER THAN THE DECISION IMPLIED.**
`ModelIdentity` named `all-MiniLM-L6-v2/onnx` — a repository, not an export — so bumping
`MINILM_REVISION` changed no cache key and every vector the previous export produced read as a hit.
It now carries the revision, which re-keys all **1,761,084** local entries.

**NOTHING COULD BE MIGRATED IN PLACE, AND THE ON-DISK FORMAT IS WHY.** An entry holds `RAGNETE1`,
the 32-byte key digest, the dimension and the floats — **never the text**. Computing a new digest
needs the input, which was never stored. Old entries are **unreachable rather than wrong** and cost
only disk. **Check the format before quoting a migration cost**: the answer was in a 44-byte header.

**THE BILL IS WHAT YOU NEXT ASK FOR, NOT WHAT YOU DISCARDED.** The cache fills lazily, one text at a
time. The nightly's two cells cost minutes; a full ablation sweep costs hours **and only if somebody
sweeps**. `2,653.6 MB` of now-unreachable vectors sits in `~/.cache/ragnet-beir/embeddings`, plus a
further `1,017 MB` in `embeddings-warmbak` — **~3.6 GB reclaimable by deleting them**, and nothing
reads either any more.

**`ModelRevisionAgreementTests` KEEPS THE TWO PINS TOGETHER.** It asserts the workflow's
`MINILM_REVISION` equals `BeirHarness.PinnedModelRevision` **and** that `ModelIdentity` is built from
that constant — two constants that agree while nothing consumes them is not the property worth
having. It reads both as **source text rather than through a project reference**, deliberately: the
constant lives in a `RequiresSecrets` project that runs in the advisory nightly tier, and a guard
living there would let the pins drift through a merge, which is the failure it exists to catch.
Three mutations each fail it.

**THE ESCAPING TAX, THIRD INSTANCE IN ONE DAY.** Writing that guard through a bash heredoc collapsed
a doubled `\\s` down to a single `\s` and mangled every regex in it,
exactly as recorded twice before. **Write C# containing regexes or quotes with the file
tool, not through a heredoc** — the workaround of building
backslashes with `chr(92)` is more fragile than simply not using the shell for it.

**Open and not mine to choose:** **#153** only. **#283** is unblocked as to instructions, blocked as
to accounts. **#246** has reported once and is still open, waiting for a second occurrence to decide
between its remaining branches. **Milestone 6 remains two account-blocked phases**, 6.1 and 6.3.

**Previously, 2026-09-14 — at the merge.** #611 merged and **#610 closed: the GraphRAG caches
are published.** GraphRAG now reproduces with no API key.

**THE BUNDLE.** `graphrag-cache-2026-09-14`, a deliberately non-`v` tag so release-please's namespace
is untouched and `v0.1.0` stays Latest. 97,640,288 bytes, md5 `b642d577be195a88aaa14ff003b27ca8`,
verified by **anonymous** download against the local file. `graph-extractions`, `graph-reports`,
`graph-answers` — 93 MB compressed, 143 MB unpacked. `docs/reference/ci.md` carries the curl and tar
commands, both **run before being written down**.

**THE PRE-PUBLICATION SCAN IS THE PART TO REMEMBER.** The first build carried
`AzureAD+<username>` in **466,032 tar headers** — never in any file's content, which was checked
separately, but stamped into every header by `tar`. It is invisible in a file listing and permanent
once published. Rebuilt with `--owner=0 --group=0 --numeric-owner` and re-scanned the **artifact**
rather than trusting the flag. **Scan any artifact before it leaves this machine**, and scan the
built thing, not the inputs.

**WHAT IS PUBLISHABLE WAS DECIDED PER DATASET, NOT PER CACHE.** MultiHop-RAG is ODC-By 1.0 **by its
own authors' declaration**; SciFact and ArguAna permit redistribution with attribution; **FiQA** names
no licence and is non-commercial only; **TREC-COVID**'s CORD-19 agreement permits text and data mining
only. The three graph caches carry MultiHop-RAG **structurally** — `BeirProtocol.GraphRag` is declared
by that dataset alone, so nothing else *can* have written there. `hypotheticals`,
`metadata-extraction` and `self-query` span the forbidden two and are hash-sharded with **no dataset
separation**, so they cannot be split without re-deriving them. That is now a property of the
licensing, not an oversight.

**THE MODEL-TERMS GATE WAS TRACED, NOT ASSUMED.** `openai.com` returns **403** to automated fetches,
so the primary source was the CDN PDF, which uses subset-font encoding and had to be decoded through
its own `ToUnicode` CMaps. Services Agreement §4.1 assigns Output to the Customer; **no clause
restricting redistribution or publication of Output exists in the document** — a searched negative.
The one Output-use restriction is developing competing models. **We are not OpenAI's Customer;
OpenRouter is**, and §6.1 delegates to the Model Terms — the release notes say so rather than
implying a cleaner chain than exists.

**TWO 404s, ONE INTERESTING, AND THE FIRST ACCOUNT OF THEM WAS WRONG.** `gh release create` treats
`file#name` as a **label, not a filename**, so the asset landed as `…-v1.tar.gz` while the notes
documented the plain name. The resulting 404 was **the correct answer to a wrong question**. Only the
post-rename 404 was propagation, and a poll returned **302 on its first attempt and all fifteen** —
so an early claim of a twenty-minute outage was an estimate stated as fact and is corrected on #610.
**Check the name you are requesting before concluding anything about propagation or permissions.**

**A GREEN COMMAND THAT CHANGED NOTHING.** The correction above nearly failed silently: Windows Python
cannot open a `/c/...` POSIX path, so the patch threw — while the `gh … --edit-last` in the same
command **succeeded**, re-posting the unchanged text. Verified afterwards by grepping the live
comment rather than trusting an exit code.

**Open and not mine to choose:** **#153**, and **#607**'s three options. **#283** is unblocked as to
instructions, blocked as to accounts. **#246** has reported once and is still open. **Milestone 6
remains two account-blocked phases**, 6.1 and 6.3.

**Previously, 2026-09-14 — at the merge.** #608 and #606 merged. **#607 filed: the embedding
cache key cannot tell two models apart.**

**THE NIGHTLY NOW CACHES BOTH HALVES OF `RAGNET_BEIR_CACHE`, AND THE TWO STEPS HOLD OPPOSITE RULES.**
The corpora must have **no** `restore-keys`; the vectors **must**. That looks like an inconsistency
waiting to be tidied, so both are asserted. The difference is a property: `EmbeddingCache` addresses
entries by SHA-256 over model identity and text, so a restored vector is either that text's vector or
is never looked up. **A stale corpus measures; a stale vector cannot be read by mistake.**

**#607 IS THE REAL FIND, AND IT CAME OUT OF WRITING THE CACHE.** `BeirHarness.ModelIdentity` is the
only salt on every embedding key, and its comment claimed it carried *everything that changes a
vector*. It does not carry the model's **revision** — the string names a repository, not an export,
while `nightly.yml` pins `MINILM_REVISION` and SHA-256-checks it on the stated grounds that a
silently different model moves the parity number unattributably. **Bump the pin and not one key
changes.** Adding the cache is what would have made that load-bearing: `restore-keys` would have
handed a bumped run the old model's vectors as hits.

**CI is covered by the Actions key; a developer machine is not.** The constant was deliberately NOT
changed — it re-keys every entry and discards every local cache, **1,761,084 entries / 2,653.6 MB**
measured here. #607 carries three options. **No measurement has ever been taken against a wrong
model**: the pin has held one value, so this is a latent trap, not a live corruption.

**A GUARD PASSED A MUTATION IT SHOULD HAVE FAILED — THE SECOND TIME IN ONE DAY.** The first version
asserted `Contains("MINILM_REVISION")` over the whole step, and removing the revision from `key:`
**passed**, because `restore-keys:` still mentioned it. Assertions are now per line. **A whole-blob
`Contains` cannot express a per-field requirement**, and a guard that spans two fields with opposite
rules will pass on either one satisfying it.

**LOCAL CACHE INVENTORY, MEASURED 2026-09-14** — the answer to "can we publish this":

| Group | Files | Size |
|---|---|---|
| `embeddings` | 1,761,084 | **2,653.6 MB** |
| every LLM-generated cache combined | ~493,000 | **~150 MB** |
| corpora, extracted plus retained zips | 24 | ~395 MB |

**The LLM caches are the ones worth publishing** — `graph-answers`, `graph-extractions`,
`graph-reports`, `hypotheticals`, `metadata-extraction`, `self-query`. They cost **money**, not time,
and they are what currently forces an OpenRouter key. 150 MB fits a release asset. **BLOCKED on
licence**: `BeirDatasetCache` says the corpora are "not ours to redistribute under", and whether
derived extractions inherit that is a per-dataset question **nobody has traced to primary sources**.
Do that before any upload.

**Vectors are NOT worth importing**, for three measured reasons: 1.76 M files is minutes of tar on
both save and restore; 2.6 GB against a 10 GB whole-repo Actions quota; and most of it is ablations
the nightly never runs. It fills its own now.

**AN E2E FAILURE WHOSE EVIDENCE I DESTROYED MYSELF.** `Rag.NET.E2ETests` failed 1 of 11 cases in a
full sweep. **The test cannot be named**, because the sweep loop piped every project through
`grep "Total:"` and discarded the rest, and MTP writes its log only on failure — so the passing
re-run left no log at all. This is the truncation mistake already recorded twice in this file, made
*in the harness written to check my own work*, two commits after shipping a guard whose whole purpose
is preserving exactly that evidence in CI. **A sweep must tee full output.**

**Measured rather than guessed at, after an early estimate of "1 in 3" from three runs:** six local
runs on 2026-09-14, **one failure — about 1 in 6**. Three dedicated captured runs afterwards all
passed 11/11. **The failing run was the fastest of the six** — 264.4 s against 288-424 s for the
passes — which is the same early-bail shape as the nightly's 4.3 s mass failures, and is a signal
rather than a diagnosis. Both sweeps ran E2E after forty-odd other projects, and only one failed, so
container contention is a candidate and not a conclusion. **Not filed**: an unnamed, unreproduced
flake with no captured output is not an actionable issue. The next sweep keeps its output.

**Open and not mine to choose:** **#153**, and **#607**'s three options. Publishing the LLM caches
waits on the licence trace. **#283** is unblocked as to instructions, blocked as to accounts. **#246**
has reported once and is still open. **Milestone 6 remains two account-blocked phases**, 6.1 and 6.3.

**Previously, 2026-09-14 — at the merge.** #605 merged, closing #175. **#246 finally
reported itself**, in CI, on this PR's build.

**#246 IS THE HEADLINE, NOT #175.** The instrumentation added 2026-09-12 and the failure-log dump
from 6.2.42 both fired on `ubuntu-latest` at 06:40:45Z and produced the evidence this issue has never
had in four weeks of being open:

| Interval | Value |
|---|---|
| Dead-lettered to lock acquired | 104 ms |
| Lock acquired to `CompleteMessageAsync` | **3.4 ms** |
| Lock remaining at the attempt | **300.0 s of 300** |

`deliveryCount=1`, `straysHeld=0`, `sequenceNumber=2`. **That rules out four things at once** — expiry
for the third time and the first from CI, the test holding the lock too long, stray interference, and
any prior redelivery. Both previous "fixes" raised `LockDuration`; both were aimed at a mechanism the
evidence now excludes three separate ways.

**AND THE TIMINGS EXPOSED A STRUCTURAL FACT THE CODE COMMENT MISSED.** `ReceiveDeadLetterAsync` is
not polling. It is called once and blocks in `ReceiveMessageAsync` for up to 60 s **while `sut` is
still running** — and `sut` is what dead-letters the message. The long-poll is satisfied *by the
dead-letter transfer itself*, 104 ms after it, so the lock is taken against an entity the broker is
mid-write on. **That is not recorded as the cause.** It is the third plausible story this bug has
had and the first two shipped as fixes.

**WHAT WAS PROPOSED IS A MEASUREMENT, NOT A FIX** — on catching `MessageLockLost`, re-receive at
once and record `sequenceNumber` and `deliveryCount`. Same sequence with `deliveryCount=1` means a
phantom delivery; `deliveryCount=2` means a real revocation; **nothing coming back means the complete
landed and only its acknowledgement was lost**, in which case every lock-directed fix has been aimed
at the wrong thing three times running.

**BOTH EMULATOR CONTAINERS ARE UNPINNED** — `servicebus-emulator:latest` and `azure-sql-edge:latest`,
and the run log shows both pulled fresh. Diagnosing an intermittent against a moving emulator on a
moving database is how it stays intermittent. Worth its own change whatever #246 turns out to be.

**#175 WAS ANSWERED AGAINST ITS FRAMING AND IN FAVOUR OF ITS CONCERN.** It asked whether one ungated
case should go behind `BeirRunBudget`. **Eleven cases** load MultiHop-RAG on the nightly gated only
on `RAGNET_BEIR_CACHE`, and **three of the ten it did not name shipped in #168 itself**, the PR it was
filed against. #229 arrived three days later citing the questioned case *by name* as its precedent.
Gating one of eleven removes no bytes.

**WHAT WAS REAL WAS THAT NOTHING CACHED THE CORPORA AT ALL.** `$RUNNER_TEMP` is fresh per job, so all
five came down every night. The nightly now caches that directory. Two properties decide whether that
is safe and `BeirCorpusCacheTests` pins both: **`embeddings` is excluded**, and there are **no
`restore-keys`** — `BeirDatasetCache` treats a directory holding `corpus.jsonl` and `queries.jsonl` as
present and never re-verifies it, because the MD5 is checked during a download a cache hit skips. All
four ways the guard can rot were mutation-checked.

**THE NIGHTLY HAS FAILED 5 OF 26 SCHEDULED RUNS SINCE 2026-08-19, AND THAT IS NOT FILED.** Three are
same-total, same-skip-count, sub-5-second mass failures of the BEIR project: 09-01 passed 137 in
16 m 41 s; 09-02 failed 9 in 4.3 s. The logs cannot name the tests. **Deliberately not attributed** —
guessing is what got #246 misdiagnosed twice. Guard C will name the next one.

**Open and not mine to choose:** **#153** only — #184 and #175 both closed today. **#283** is
unblocked as to instructions and blocked as to accounts. **Milestone 6 remains two account-blocked
phases**, 6.1 and 6.3.

**Previously, 2026-09-14 — at the merge.** #603 merged; #283's body edited in place.

**#283 IS STILL BLOCKED, AND NOT BY ANYTHING IN THIS REPOSITORY.** It needs people with ordinary
accounts on Asana, Notion, Slack and the rest. The operator lacking those is the blocker the issue
names, and no amount of work here moves it. **What was fixable was that volunteers hit an error at
step 2**, which is now fixed.

**THREE BROKEN COMMANDS IN THE ISSUE, NOT THE ONE FIRST REPORTED** — the record step, the
secret-guard check and the replay verification all said `dotnet test --filter`, refused repo-wide
with `RAGNET0001` since 6.2.41. Each replacement was **verified to select what it claims**, not
merely to run: 3 tests for the Asana class, 4 for `CassetteSecretTests`. That distinction is the
point — the old `--filter` *looked* like it selected one test while running the whole assembly, so
"the command runs" was never evidence.

**The opening line was corrected too.** It promised "no .NET expertise beyond running `dotnet
test`", which is no longer the shape of the task and would have walked a contributor into the exact
error the rest of the fix removes.

**THIRD INSTANCE OF THE SAME ENUMERATION FAILURE.** 6.2.41 converted thirteen `--filter` commands
and enumerated the ones in `docs/reference/ci.md`. Everything outside that file kept its broken
form: `BeirRunBudget` (#601), `docs/reference/retrieval-quality.md` (#603), and this issue. **The
rule the phase itself recorded — enumerate the occurrences, do not reason about where they live —
was applied to a directory rather than to the repository.** Published docs and the issue tracker
are now clean; the only surviving mentions are the prose explaining the ban.

**A verification habit that failed twice today, both mine:** `git grep` for merged content without
`-i`, reporting MISSING for text I had written in capitals. Both times the content was on `main`.
Case-fold the check, or grep a distinctive lowercase fragment.

**Milestone 6 remains two account-blocked phases** — 6.1 and 6.3. **Open and not mine to choose:**
#184, #175, #153. **#283** is unblocked as to instructions and blocked as to accounts. **#246**
waits to report itself.

**Previously, 2026-09-14 — at the merge.** #298 closed; #599, #600 and #601 merged.

**A QUESTION ABOUT MULTILINGUAL PROMPTS ENDED IN A MEASURED ANSWER TO A YEAR-OLD ARCHITECTURE
QUESTION.** The chain: prompts are already per-caller configurable, so the real defect was that one
prompt's English wording was load-bearing for parsing (#596/#597) — then #299's survey turned out
already fixed — then #298's re-measurement, never run, finally was.

**#298 IS CLOSED, AND ITS OWN RECOMMENDATION WAS VINDICATED RATHER THAN OVERTURNED.** It argued
"not yet, and the reason is specific rather than conservative": the pain attributed to SQLite was a
schema defect, and a new engine benchmarked against a known-wrong schema would be flattered. **Now
measured.** The traversal term derived at **15-40 minutes** cannot fit inside a local-search pass
that takes **208.0 s and 202.7 s** over two runs, and the `relationships` table is unchanged at
147,021 rows — an *indexed* problem, not a smaller one.

**THE NUMBER CARRIES ITS OWN CAVEAT, DELIBERATELY.** The wall-clock drop from 43 m 29 s is mostly
the embedding cache: both runs report **325,661 hits and zero misses**, where 2026-08-15 recorded
145,840 hits against **177,566 misses**. None of that drop is claimed for the index. The traversal
conclusion survives because embedding warmth does not touch SQL scans.

**WHAT CLOSING #298 DOES NOT SETTLE, said on the issue so nobody reads it as settled:**
concurrency — `SqliteGraphStore` still holds one `SqliteConnection` opened in the constructor and
registered as a singleton, which #298 itself called the strongest argument — and collapsing two
databases for Postgres users. Either needs its own issue and its own evidence.

**MEASUREMENT DISCIPLINE, LEARNED EXPENSIVELY IN ONE EVENING.** The first attempt gave **713 s**,
the second **287 s**, for the identical command — while a Hyper-V VM held all but **3.4 GB** of
63.7 GB. After the operator stopped it, two runs agreed to **0.8%**. **One run would have produced a
confident wrong number**; the repo's own `CostReproducibility` rule refuses a figure from a single
run, and this is why. Conditions are now recorded beside the figure, including the failed attempt.

**AND THE MEASUREMENT NEARLY WENT UNRECORDED TWICE.** The first successful run used a command
without `-showLiveOutput`, so the test's own figures — including the cache counts that decide
comparability — were never captured. Then the captured output *was* in the log and a `cut -c1-170`
hid it. **Truncation cost three separate findings today.**

**#601: THE PRINTED COMMAND DID NOT WORK AND HAD TO BE FIXED TO FOLLOW THE ISSUE.** Every gated
cell said `dotnet test --filter`, which has raised `RAGNET0001` since 6.2.41. Converting it meant
moving three guards with it, because the printed string is a guarded artifact — it selected nothing
once and `vstest` exited 0, recording a pass for a run that never happened. **The new dataset guard
failed 12 cells on its first run, on my own prose**: it read the whole skip message and tripped on
the sentence warning readers off `--filter`. Fourth calibration failure this week, first one where
the thing caught was mine.

**TOOLING NOTE THAT COST THREE PATCHES.** Heredocs here collapse `\` to `\`, so a C# `'\n'`
literal became a real newline. Build backslashes with `chr(92)` when patching source that contains
them.

**Milestone 6 remains two account-blocked phases** — 6.1 and 6.3. **Open and not mine to choose:**
#283, #184, #175, #153. **#246** waits to report itself.

**Previously, 2026-09-13 — at the merge.** #596 fixed and closed in #597; #559 recorded in
#594.

**A DESIGN QUESTION ABOUT MULTILINGUAL PROMPTS FOUND A CORRECTNESS BUG.** Asked whether the system
prompts should become configurable per language. **They are already configurable** —
`RagOptions.SystemPrompt`, `MapPromptTemplate`, `ReducePromptTemplate`, `EntityExtractionPrompt`,
`SystemPrefix` and the rest all take any language. Per-language variants would choose the language
*for* the caller and leave the real defect untouched.

**THE REAL DEFECT: one prompt's English wording was load-bearing for parsing.** MapReduce asked the
model to reply `"not found"` for an irrelevant excerpt, then filtered on that exact phrase. A
non-English system prompt yields `nicht gefunden`, the match fails, and **the excerpt is treated as
relevant** — its I-found-nothing sentence flowing into the reduce step as source material, silently.

**IT HAD ALREADY COST A CORRECT ANSWER, IN ENGLISH.** The repository held a measured transcript from
2026-08-30 on an existing test: real maps returned `Not found. The answer to the question is "not
found".` under a caller formatting instruction; three refusals reached the reduce, which called it a
contradiction and **discarded the answer it had**. That earlier fix appended the protocol last,
making the failure less likely while leaving the exact match in place.

**THE FIX:** a symbolic `<NOT_FOUND>` token, recognised with `Contains` rather than equality — which
is what makes the 2026-08-30 shape *survivable* rather than merely unlikely. `FlareAnswerEngine` had
always used a symbolic token for the same reason; the two engines now agree. **The legacy phrase is
still recognised**, because a caller with a custom `MapPromptTemplate` saying "not found" would
otherwise break in exactly the silent way the change removes.

**THE TRANSCRIPT WAS KEPT WHEN THE TEST WAS UPDATED.** Changing the sentinel meant editing an
assertion that pinned the old wording — the move #559 warns against. It was right here because the
change *is* the decision and it is issue-backed, but the 2026-08-30 history was left intact: it is
the evidence for the new shape, and deleting it would have removed the reason while keeping the
result.

**A TOOLING NOTE THAT COST THREE ATTEMPTS.** Heredocs in this environment collapse `\` to `\`, so
patch scripts matching C# escape sequences silently fail to find their anchors — and the same
collapse produced the `SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence` messages seen earlier today. Build
the backslashes with `chr(92)` when matching source that contains them.

**Milestone 6 remains two account-blocked phases** — 6.1 and 6.3. **Open and not mine to choose:**
#298, #283, #184, #175, #153. **#246** waits to report itself.

**AI.Sentinel #205 is CLOSED** — since 2026-09-12, and it was listed as outstanding here and in
conversation throughout 2026-09-13 anyway. **Exactly the staleness this session kept finding in
issues, in the status list used to find it**: #299, #184 and #560 were all fixed-but-open, and
the check that caught them was never turned on the tracker entry itself. Verify a carried item
the same way a claim is verified.

**Previously, 2026-09-13 — at the merge.** #559 closed in #593. **This empties the
locally-finishable queue.**

**#559 WAS NOT A BUG. IT WAS A DEFENSIBLE DECISION THAT NOTHING RECORDED.**
`QuerySanitiserPipelineDecorator` forwards `RetrieveAsync` unsanitised while sanitising `AskAsync`
and `AskStreamingAsync`. No doc comment on the file, no test over that path, nothing published —
**which is indistinguishable from an oversight to everyone except its author.** Confirmed
deliberate by the operator; the reasoning now lives in the type's remarks, and a test pins it.

**The reasoning:** injection hijacks a model and `RetrieveAsync` reaches none, since it returns
chunks to a caller who decides what to do with them. Redacting `ignore previous` from a legitimate
query *about* that phrase would corrupt the search terms while protecting nothing. **The cost is
stated rather than left to be discovered:** a retrieval-only caller gets nothing on their path.

**THE TEST SAYS WHAT TO DO WHEN IT FAILS.** Revisit the decision; do not update the assertion. A
test quietly edited to match new behaviour is how a security scope changes without anyone deciding
to change it. Verified non-vacuous by mutation.

## Where the project stands

**Milestone 6 is down to its two account-blocked phases** — 6.1 Recorded Responses and 6.3 Release
v1.0. **Nothing else can be advanced without the operator's accounts.**

**Not blocked, but not mine to choose:** #299, #298, #283, #184, #175, #153 are research questions,
design decisions or explicitly help-wanted — each needs a direction before code.

**Waiting on itself:** #246's emulator race. The diagnostic shipped in #581 means the next
occurrence arrives with its lock state attached. **Lock expiry is already ruled out by
measurement**, and the leading candidate is that something settles the message first — the
signature of a deliberate double-settle matches the real failure exactly.

**Elsewhere:** AI.Sentinel #205.

**Addressed, awaiting a close:** #560 and #575.

## The lesson this run keeps producing

**Four times in two days a guard's calibration, not its idea, was the defect** — a 42-vs-3 count
from two reasonable greps; a proposal-scan finding 1 where the answer was 7; #560's guard failing
eleven *correct* entries; #575's flagging two files for a doc comment. **Twice, mutation-testing
was the only thing between me and editing correct work to satisfy a broken check.** Budget for
calibration, and mutation-test a guard before trusting any number it produces.

**Previously, 2026-09-13 — at the merge.** #587 fixed and closed in #590.

**A PAPERCUT THAT WAS A VERBAL NOTE FIVE TIMES BECAME AN ISSUE, THEN A FIX, IN ABOUT FORTY
MINUTES.** `EveryPackageCarriesTheVersionGitVersionDerives` failed on **every branch switch**,
because GitVersion takes the prerelease label from the branch name — six occurrences in one day,
each costing a ~3-minute repack of 73 packages. It now skips when the packed versions are
internally consistent and differ from the derived version **only in the prerelease label**, which
is all a branch switch changes.

**THE CARE WAS IN WHAT IT STILL REFUSES TO EXCUSE**, because turning a failure into a skip is
exactly how a guard stops guarding unnoticed. The SDK default `1.0.0` — the defect this guard
exists for — differs in `MajorMinorPatch` rather than in the label, so it still fails; so do
versions that disagree with each other, a missing `<version>`, and a wrong `Major.Minor.Patch`.
Seven cases pin the boundary. **CI cannot reach the skip at all**: both workflows pack on the
commit they then check.

**THE DECISION WAS EXTRACTED AS A PURE FUNCTION SO IT COULD BE TESTED.** Inline, verifying it would
have meant packing 73 packages twice. That is the general move whenever a guard grows a relaxation:
make the relaxation testable without the expensive setup the guard needs.

**It demonstrated itself on its first run** — `artifacts/packages` still held the previous branch's
build, so the very branch that introduced the fix hit the condition and skipped with the real
message.

**STILL OPEN AND MINE:** #559 is the last locally-finishable one, and it is a **design decision
rather than code** — whether `UseQuerySanitiser` skipping `RetrieveAsync` is deliberate. #560 and
#575 are addressed and await a close.

**Milestone 6 remains two account-blocked phases** — 6.1 and 6.3. Also finishable: #246 once it
reports itself, and AI.Sentinel #205.

**Previously, 2026-09-13 — at the merge.** #575's derived guard merged as #588. Issue work,
not a numbered phase.

**KEYING ON THE GROUND TRUTH FOUND MORE THAN KEYING ON THE SYMPTOM.** #575 reported two skip sites
missing the provisioning hint, found by searching for an identical sentence. Keying on the **five
variables `~/.cache/ragnet-beir/env.sh` actually exports** found **five** — the other three phrase
their gates differently and a sentence search could never have seen them.

**AND THE SENTENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG THE OTHER WAY.** Seventeen test files carry a
`"Set RAGNET_…"` message, but most gate on Whisper, Tesseract or Document Intelligence settings
`env.sh` does not provision. **A phrasing-keyed guard would have demanded a false claim in six
places.** #575 called "which gates count" the real work; the answer is that the variable list is
ground truth and the wording is not.

**THE INVENTORY NOW DERIVES ITSELF.** `SkipReasonWiringTests` walks `tests/`, selects files that
*call* a skip and name a provisioned variable, and requires the hint — directly or through a shared
skip reason that already carries it, which ~30 cases do via `BeirHarness.SkipReason`. A new test
gating on a provisioned variable is caught the day it is written; adding a **variable** is a
deliberate one-line decision. The five names are hard-coded because **CI has no copy of `env.sh`**.

**TWO CALIBRATION MISTAKES, AND THE PATTERN IS NOW UNMISTAKABLE.** A substring match on
`Assert.Skip` flagged two files that only mention it in **doc comments**; fixed by matching the call
shape `TestGateTests.SkipGateCall()` already uses, deliberately the same so two guards cannot
disagree about what a skip site is. And **the first mutation test passed when it should have
failed** — it removed one of a file's two hint calls, but the guard is per-file by design, since one
`SkipReason` property legitimately serves several sites.

**THIS IS THE FOURTH TIME IN TWO DAYS THAT A GUARD'S CALIBRATION, NOT ITS IDEA, WAS THE DEFECT.**
Text scans gave 42-vs-3 for one quantity; a proposal-language scan found 1 where the real answer was
7; #560's guard failed eleven correct entries by accepting types but not members; and this one
flagged two files for a doc comment. **The idea was right every time. The matcher was wrong every
time.** Budget for calibrating a guard, and mutation-test it before trusting a number it produces.

**A PRIOR RULING WAS REVERSED, CORRECTLY.** 6.2.42 duplicated the hint helper rather than couple
unrelated test projects — right at two copies, wrong at five call sites across four projects with
nothing keeping them in step. It now lives in `Rag.NET.Testing`.

**FILED: #587**, the `artifacts/packages` papercut — `EveryPackageCarriesTheVersionGitVersionDerives`
fails on every branch switch because GitVersion derives the version from the branch name. **Six
occurrences in one day**, each costing a ~3-minute repack of 73 packages. Filed after being carried
as a verbal note five times.

**STILL OPEN FOR THE OPERATOR:** close **#571** as a duplicate of **#246**, and close **#560** and
**#575** if their findings satisfy.

**Milestone 6 remains two account-blocked phases** — 6.1 and 6.3. **Locally finishable:** #559,
#587, #246 once it reports itself, and AI.Sentinel #205.

**Previously, 2026-09-13 — at the merge.** #560's guard merged as #584. Issue work, not a
numbered phase.

**#560's PREMISE WAS MEASURED AND DID NOT HOLD.** It asks whether other `✅ Done` entries in
`features.md` are stale proposals. Across **all 64** — the issue says 53; the surface grew —
**exactly one** carries proposal-shaped language, and the entry that prompted the issue was already
corrected by 6.2.40. The rest are backed by shipping code, spot-checked against source. **Not 52
unaudited false claims: one stale entry, already fixed.**

**WHAT WAS REAL: seven entries named nothing a reader could call** — which is the original complaint,
that the prompting entry "named none of the shipped registration methods". Each now names its entry
point, and `FeatureClaimSymbolTests` requires every Done entry with a **Package:** line to name a
backticked token that **resolves against the produced assemblies**, reusing the catalog
`DocsCodeExamplesTests` already trusts.

**TWO WRONG ANSWERS ON THE WAY, AND THE SECOND NEARLY DID DAMAGE.** Three text-shape scans were
tried and the first two were confidently wrong — one stripped the `**Status:**` line, which is
*exactly* where several entries name their type, and one rejected `GetDeltaToken()` for carrying
parentheses. Then **the guard's own first draft failed eleven entries** by accepting types only,
including ones naming `DecayRate`, `AskAsync` and `SystemPrompt` — callable entry points that happen
to be members. **Editing eleven correct entries to satisfy it would have damaged the documentation
to please a bad check.** Widened instead: 11 failures became the 7 real ones.

**THE LESSON, THIRD TIME THIS WEEK: a mechanical check is only worth what its calibration is worth.**
Prefer resolving symbols against assemblies over matching prose shapes, and when a guard fails work
you believe is correct, suspect the guard before editing the work.

**WHAT NO GUARD SETTLES.** One resolvable symbol is enough, so an entry naming a real type while
describing behaviour that type does not have still passes. `FeatureClaimTests` still cannot tell
whether described work was done. That residual is recorded on #560 rather than implied away.

**STILL OPEN FOR THE OPERATOR, and the list is not shrinking:** close **#571** as a duplicate of
**#246**; close **#560** if the measurement satisfies; and file the `artifacts/packages` papercut —
**five occurrences now**, every branch switch, because GitVersion derives the version from the branch
name and `EveryPackageCarriesTheVersionGitVersionDerives` compares against it. The fix is probably to
skip the check when the packages were built for a different branch.

**Milestone 6 remains two account-blocked phases** — 6.1 and 6.3. **Locally finishable:** #559,
#575, #246 once it reports itself, and AI.Sentinel #205.

**Previously, 2026-09-13 — at the merge.** #246's diagnostic merged as #581. Not a numbered
phase: issue work, recorded here because the findings outlive it.

**#246's MECHANISM IS RULED OUT BY MEASUREMENT. BOTH PREVIOUS FIXES WERE INERT.** The intermittent
`MessageLockLost` in `ReceiveDeadLetterAsync` had been diagnosed twice as lock expiry and fixed twice
by raising the queue's `LockDuration`, most recently `PT1M` → `PT5M`. Instrumenting the line that
throws showed the lock carrying its **full 300 seconds** at the moment of the call, on every observed
run — matching the CI failure that threw **1.318 s** into the test. **A lock with five minutes left
has not expired.** Neither change could ever have helped.

**IT REPRODUCES LOCALLY — NOT CI-ONLY, NOT UBUNTU-ONLY.** 1 failure in 20 runs on Windows against the
same emulator image. `straysHeld=0` and `deliveryCount=1` on every pass, so the stray-accumulation
path is not involved and the message is on its first delivery.

**A NEW CLUE, FROM VERIFYING THE DIAGNOSTIC RATHER THAN FROM THEORISING.** Forcing a deliberate
double-settle produced `MessageLockLost` with `lockRemaining=300.0s` — **the same signature as the
real failure.** Settling an already-settled message reports a lost lock while the lock still looks
valid. So of the two candidates the exception names, *"already been removed from the queue"* now
leads over *"received by a different receiver instance"*. **Consistent with, not proof of** — but the
first time this bug's mechanism has been narrowed by measurement rather than argument.

**NOT FIXED, DELIBERATELY.** The failure could not be caught with instrumentation attached: 20 local
runs, 5 full-project runs, and 8-way CPU pressure all stayed green. **Guessing a third time is how
the first two fixes happened.** What shipped is the evidence path — silent on the passing path, and
since 6.2.42 CI dumps a failing project's log, so **the next occurrence arrives self-documenting**.

**THE CANDIDATE FIX, RECORDED RATHER THAN TAKEN.** `ReceiveDeadLetterAsync` receives-and-completes
purely to read `DeadLetterReason`. This class already prefers peeking on shared queues —
`QueueStillHoldsAsync` does, with a comment explaining why — and **a peek takes no lock, so
`MessageLockLost` becomes structurally impossible.** Not done: it would remove the failure without
explaining it, and peek has not been confirmed to expose `DeadLetterReason` on the emulator's
dead-letter sub-queue. Decide once the next failure reports itself.

**STILL OPEN FOR THE OPERATOR:** close **#571** as a duplicate of **#246**, and file the
`artifacts/packages` papercut — every branch switch invalidates it, because GitVersion derives the
version from the branch name and `EveryPackageCarriesTheVersionGitVersionDerives` compares against
it. Hit four times now. The fix is probably to skip the check when the packages were built for a
different branch, rather than repacking each time.

**Milestone 6 remains two account-blocked phases** — 6.1 and 6.3. **Locally finishable:** #559, #560,
#575, #246 itself once it reports, and AI.Sentinel #205.

**Previously, 2026-09-12 — at the merge, as the previous ten were.** 6.2.43 merged as #577.

**GUARD C PAID FOR ITSELF THE SAME DAY IT SHIPPED, AND IT OVERTURNED A CONCLUSION THIS PROJECT HAD
ACTED ON TWICE.** #577's CI went red on the same AzureServiceBus flake that cost a full log read, a
count comparison against `main` and an out-of-repo reproduction this morning — and still could not be
attributed. This time the dump printed it in one command:

> `failed ServiceBusIngestionIntegrationTests.PermanentFailure_LandsInTheDeadLetterQueueWithItsReason (1s 318ms)`
> `ServiceBusException : The lock supplied is invalid … (MessageLockLost).`
> `at ServiceBusReceiver.CompleteMessageAsync(…)` / `at …ReceiveDeadLetterAsync(…)`

**That is #246's test and #246's exception, and #246 is closed.** #571 was filed only because the
test could not be named; it now can, and both issues carry the evidence.

**The timing falsifies the standing diagnosis.** The failure is **1.318 s** into the test, and
`Config.json` declares **`PT5M`**. A five-minute lock cannot expire 1.3 seconds in, so **lock duration
is not the mechanism and both prior fixes that raised `LockDuration` were inert** — exactly what
`EmulatorLockBehaviourTests` was written to suspect after #246 was misdiagnosed twice. The failing
call is `CompleteMessageAsync` on a dead-letter message just received, which is the shape the
*stopped-processor* hypothesis predicts, not the shape lock expiry predicts.
`AStoppedProcessorConsumesNothingMore` already exists to test it.

**A re-run of the identical commit passed**, confirming the flake. The race itself remains unfixed;
6.2.42 scoped only the reporting, deliberately.

**Previously in this entry's phase — 6.2.43 shrank twice, both times before any code.**

**THE PHASE SHRANK TWICE, BOTH TIMES BEFORE ANY CODE WAS WRITTEN, AND THAT IS THE USEFUL PART.**
6.2.43 was scoped from #184 to add a fluent entry point. What it shipped is **one test and one
sentence**.

1. **The design contradicted itself.** It asserted both that the new builder methods would delegate
   to `AddChatClient` and that nothing new would enter core's dependency closure. `AddChatClient`
   lives in `Microsoft.Extensions.AI`; `src/Rag.NET` references only
   `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions`. Both could not hold.
2. **Then the operator asked whether it was over-engineering, and it was.** The methods unified
   syntax without reducing decisions — same objects constructed, same three things the caller must
   know exist, and the verbose part was never the registration but the client construction, unchanged
   either way. Against a stated goal of *"fewest decisions to something working"*, **the decision
   count was identical and only the punctuation moved.** The cost was a core package reference plus
   **two ways to register one service** — the trap the design had rejected its own alternative for
   laying, which is an inconsistency in the reasoning rather than a nuance.

**WHAT SHIPPED IS A DELETED CONSTRAINT THAT NEVER EXISTED.** `getting-started.md` told readers to
*"Register them before calling `AddRagNet`"*. `RegistrationOrderTests` registers both orders, resolves
the pipeline in each, and asserts each container hands back the **exact instances registered** —
because resolving in both orders proves only that neither throws, not that they agree. Both pass.
Every consumption goes through `sp.GetService` inside a factory lambda, so order is irrelevant.

**#184's PREMISE HAD DRIFTED AND TWO OF ITS CLAIMS WERE DEAD.** The builder already exists and the
quickstart already chains; **#181 is merged**, killing its "the bump is happening regardless"
argument, and **#161 is closed**. Commented on the issue rather than closed, since the single-statement
setup remains a legitimate taste call for the maintainer.

**A CONSEQUENCE FOR WHOEVER PLANS NEXT.** #184 is labelled `breaking-change` and was the strongest
remaining argument for doing breaking work before v1.0 tags. **6.2.43 shipped nothing breaking, so
that deadline argument has dissolved** — the rest of the locally-finishable work can be sequenced on
merit rather than against the release.

**TWO METHOD NOTES, BOTH OF WHICH NEARLY PRODUCED FALSE FINDINGS.** Counting the extension surface by
grep gave **42 and 3 for the same quantity**, because C# signatures wrap across lines. And locating
symbols in the M.E.AI assemblies with `strings` reported **zero matches for everything** — the command
is not installed on this machine, which reads exactly like proof of absence. Both were caught; neither
would have been obvious in review.

**GUARD C PAID FOR ITSELF.** `PackageValidation` failed twice this phase on stale `.nupkg` files from
the previous branch, and 6.2.42's CI log dump named the failing test and the exact cause in one
command both times — its first use on a real failure outside the phase that built it.

**NOT FILED, A RECURRING PAPERCUT:** every branch switch invalidates `artifacts/packages`, because
GitVersion derives the version from the branch name and `EveryPackageCarriesTheVersionGitVersionDerives`
compares against it. **Third occurrence this session.** The fix is probably to have the guard skip
when the packages were built for a different branch, rather than to repack each time.

**Milestone 6 remains two account-blocked phases** — 6.1 Recorded Responses and 6.3 Release v1.0.
**Locally finishable:** #559, #560, #575, #571's emulator race, and AI.Sentinel #205. **#314 stays
open**, correctly attributed to SDK support.

**Previously, 2026-09-12 — at the merge, as the previous nine were.** 6.2.42 merged as #572;
this entry was written from the session that built it, on `chore/6242-merged`.

**THE GUARDS CAUGHT THINGS WHILE BEING BUILT, WHICH IS THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT COUNTS FOR THIS
PHASE.** Two findings are worth carrying forward more than the guards themselves:

1. **The em-dash test earned its keep the day it was written.** `${#header}` counted **bytes under
   bash** — not only under `sh`, which is all the plan predicted — because this environment sets
   neither `LANG` nor `LC_ALL`. The first fix, `export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8`, then turned out to fail
   **silently** on a machine lacking that locale: `export` exits 0 regardless, so `set -e` never
   fires, and the hook would have rejected valid headers while printing "the header is 104
   characters" — a message indistinguishable from the guard working. It now probes a known
   one-character, three-byte string and refuses to run if the count is wrong.
2. **Guard B's wirings were covered by nothing, and only the final whole-branch review saw it.**
   Deleting the hint call from either Onnx file failed no test on any machine; on a corpus-less
   runner — every CI runner — the composition test took its null branch and passed even with the
   suffix removed. **The sentences were tested; nothing tested that anything used them.** Two
   task-scoped reviews missed this because each saw only its own diff.

**A PREMISE WAS FALSIFIED BY EVIDENCE RATHER THAN LEFT OPEN.** The design and plan both recorded
the Linux MTP log encoding as unverified, and the BOM sniff was written to hedge it. Docker was
available, so it was checked instead of reasoned about — twice, by the implementer and
independently by the reviewer, each in a fresh `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0` container with
no reused Windows build output. **Linux produces the identical UTF-16LE with a `fffe` BOM**, so
`iconv` fires on both platforms and `cat` is the dead branch. The stale caveat was corrected in the
implementation plan; the design never made the claim.

**WHAT THE PHASE DELIBERATELY DID NOT DO.** Guard A's **adoption cannot be tested** — a hook does
nothing until someone runs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`, so it helps contributors who opt
in and nobody else, including a future session on a fresh clone. The *enumerate-the-suites* rule
stays prose, because a guard for it would have to make the judgement the rule disciplines. Neither
is an oversight; both are recorded in the design, the tests' own remarks and the phase record.

**ONE GAP FOUND AT THE END AND NOT CLOSED.**
`tests/Rag.NET.Chunking.IntegrationTests/LateChunkingIntegrationTests.cs:46` and `:96` carry the
**identical** skip sentence Guard B fixed elsewhere, gated on the same `RAGNET_ONNX_EMBED_*` pair
set by the same `env.sh`, with no hint — and `OnnxEmbeddingGeneratorSmokeTests`' own class doc names
that file as sharing the gate. Guard B's premise applies to them exactly. Related:
`SkipReasonWiringTests` pins a **hardcoded four-site inventory**, so it cannot notice a site that
never got a hint. `SecurityDocumentationTests` is the stronger precedent in this repository — it
derives its list from the filesystem, so it fails when someone **adds** one. **Filed as #575.**

**Milestone 6 remains two account-blocked phases** — 6.1 Recorded Responses and 6.3 Release v1.0.
**Locally finishable:** #184 (breaking, pre-1.0 is the moment), #559 and #560 from 6.2.40, #571's
emulator race (this phase made it legible, deliberately without chasing it), the gap above, and
AI.Sentinel #205 in the other repository. **#314 stays open**, correctly attributed to SDK support.

**Previously, 2026-09-12 — complete, not yet pushed, and its final whole-branch review's
findings are fixed.** A final whole-branch review of `feat/6242-mechanical-guards` found ten
findings — one guard test reading raw YAML text where `TestProject.ReadWorkflowCommands` already
existed for exactly that mistake; three "BEIR present but unreferenced" hint call sites wired to
nothing any test would notice if deleted; a doc comment and a pre-push-review sentence both stating
an overload relationship backwards; a workflow comment still hedging on Linux after this same phase
closed that question with evidence; a ROADMAP sentence claiming a correction the design document
never needed; a `STATE.md` paragraph (below) contradicting its own parenthetical; the off-by-one
commit count this paragraph itself carried; a third Onnx skip site that never got the hint its two
siblings did; and two documentation gaps — the hook's locale dependency, and its one-line adoption
path buried 900 lines into a reference page. All ten are fixed on this branch.

**The hardest of the ten, and the one this entry singles out:** the BEIR-hint wiring tests could
have their `+ …Hint()` suffix deleted from any of the three `SkipReason` properties and nothing
would fail, on any CI runner — a pure runtime composition test cannot tell "the call happened and
returned empty" from "the call was deleted" when the live hint is empty, which it always is on a
machine without `~/.cache/ragnet-beir`. Closed with a new `RepoConventions` guard,
`SkipReasonWiringTests`, that reads each `SkipReason` property's own source text — anchored on the
property's signature so a doc comment describing the call cannot satisfy it — and asserts the hint
call appears inside its expression body. That is deterministic on any machine, because it never
touches the environment. The runtime composition test in
`Rag.NET.Benchmarks.Quality.IntegrationTests.SkipMessageTests` stays too, tightened to an exact
equality on the composed string rather than a substring check — it still catches a wrong
composition whenever the live hint happens to be non-null, which it is on this machine.

**Counts after the fix wave:** `RepoConventions` **111 passed / 2 skipped** (was 107/2, +4 from the
new wiring guard's four `[InlineData]` cases), `Embeddings.Onnx.Tests` unchanged at 141/10
unprovisioned and 151/0 provisioned, `Rag.NET.Benchmarks.Quality.IntegrationTests` unchanged at
154/118 unprovisioned and 180/92 provisioned, build 0 warnings. Full account, including which of
Important 2's two offered approaches was chosen and why, in
`.superpowers/sdd/2026-09-12-mechanical-guards-implementation/final-fix-report.md`.

**Previously, 2026-09-12 — the phase's own record, before its final whole-branch review.**
**Complete, not yet pushed.** All three guards are built and tested
on `feat/6242-mechanical-guards` (ten commits ahead of `main` at `305db773`), and this entry was written from the
session that verified the phase and wrote its record. Unlike the last several entries, this one is
not "at the merge" — by explicit instruction the PR is opened afterward, by the operator, not by this
session, so nothing here has merged yet.

**All seven Step-1 suites match their stated expectations exactly, and both BEIR triples confirm
Guard B's premise.** `RepoConventions` 107 passed / 2 skipped (was 101/2 before this phase's six new
tests), `PackageValidation` 23/23 (no repack needed — `artifacts/packages` was not stale), `Rag.NET.Tests`
1499/1499, build 0 warnings, docs site builds. Sourced `~/.cache/ragnet-beir/env.sh` before writing
anything about provisioning: `Embeddings.Onnx.Tests` went from 141 passed / 10 skipped to **151/0**;
`Rag.NET.Benchmarks.Quality.IntegrationTests` went from 154/118 to **180 passed / 92 skipped** — the
same class of gap Guard B's message exists to name. `Rag.NET.E2ETests` did not run — `RequiresLlm`,
nightly-only, correctly out of scope here.

**THE LINUX ENCODING QUESTION IS CLOSED BY EVIDENCE.**
`docs/plans/2026-09-12-mechanical-guards-implementation.md`'s self-review said the Linux log
encoding was unverified and that the BOM sniff existed because of that uncertainty (the design
document's own prose never made the claim — checked directly — so only the implementation plan
needed correcting, in two places). It was verified **twice** during Task 1: once by the implementer, once independently
by the re-reviewer, each inside a fresh `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:10.0` container with no reused
Windows build output. **Linux produces the identical UTF-16LE-with-`FFFE`-BOM encoding Windows
does.** The `iconv` branch is the one that fires on every platform checked; the `else: cat` branch is
dead code, kept only against a future runner disagreeing. Both stale passages were rewritten to say
the question was closed rather than left open.

**THE EM-DASH TEST CAUGHT A REAL DEFECT ON THE DAY IT WAS WRITTEN, AND THE PLAN'S OWN PREDICTION WAS
TOO NARROW.** The plan predicted a byte-counting hook would reject valid headers and blamed `sh`/
`dash`. The truth was wider: `${#header}` counted **bytes under bash itself**, because this
environment sets neither `LANG` nor `LC_ALL` at all. The first fix — `export LC_ALL=C.UTF-8` — was
then found by review to fail **silently** on a machine lacking that locale: `export` exits `0` even
when the named locale does not exist, so `set -e` never fires, and the hook would have reintroduced
the identical byte-counting trap one layer down, printing a false rejection that looks exactly like
the guard working. The hook now carries a behavioural probe — it measures a known one-character,
three-byte string (an em dash) and refuses to run at all if the count comes back wrong, rather than
trusting the locale's name. This is the phase's clearest evidence for its own thesis: a rule written
down (byte-counting is the risk to guard against) was broken by the very commit meant to guard
against it, on the day that commit was written, and only caught because the guard was executed against
a real string rather than read as a diff.

**GUARD A'S ADOPTION IS STATED AS UNTESTED AND UNTESTABLE — NOT IMPLIED AS ENFORCED.** The hook does
nothing on a fresh clone until someone runs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` by hand.
`core.hooksPath` happens to be set to `.githooks` in this one clone, which is a fact about this
clone, not about the repository's contributors in general; `CommitMessageHookTests` proves the
script behaves correctly when run, not that anyone has wired it in. The design, the implementation
plan, and `CommitMessageHookTests.cs`'s own class remark all say the same thing, and this entry
repeats it rather than letting a "complete" phase status imply otherwise.

**Pre-push review PASS** — `docs/pre-push-review-2026-09-12-1359.md`, 0 blockers, one cosmetic
info-level finding (a workflow comment naming only Windows for an encoding now confirmed identical on
Linux — not incorrect, no behavioral effect). All ten commit headers (through `305db773`) are under
the 100-character cap (max 93), no nested parentheses in any commit body, no session URL anywhere. Guard C's central
claim — a red build naming the failing test — was demonstrated by a deliberate failure on two
platforms, never by a green run; that verbatim output is quoted in full in the pre-push review report
and in `task-1-report.md`.

**What is left for next: the operator opens the PR** (explicitly out of scope for this session —
Task 4's brief says to open it, the operator is doing that afterward) **and merges it.** Nothing else
is outstanding on this phase.

**Previously, 2026-09-12 — at the merge, as the previous eight were.** 6.2.42 was scoped and
merged as #570; this entry was written from the session that scoped it, on
`feat/6242-mechanical-guards`.

**CI WENT RED ON A MARKDOWN-ONLY PR AND THE LOG COULD NOT SAY WHICH TEST FAILED.** #570 changes
nothing but documentation, and `build-test (ubuntu-latest)` reported
`Rag.NET.Ingestion.AzureServiceBus.Tests` at **81 passed / 1 failed / 82 total**. Main's run twenty
minutes earlier reported **82 / 82** on the same runner and tier. Identical totals mean no test was
added or removed, so the diff could not be the cause. **Re-running the identical commit passed**,
which settles it as a flake. The suite is the one #246 was filed against — *MessageLockLost on
ubuntu, emulator race* — and **#246 is closed**, so nothing is currently tracking it.

**6.2.41 REMOVED FAILURE DETAIL FROM CI OUTPUT, AND THIS IS THE FIRST RED BUILD SINCE.** Between
`Run tests:` and `Failed! - Failed: 1` the job log contains **nothing** — no test name, no assertion,
no stack trace, and zero GitHub annotations. The MTP migration is the cause and it is not
ubuntu-specific: reproduced with a throwaway two-test project outside the repository, where a
deliberate `Assert.Equal` failure produced **zero** console mentions of either the test name or the
assertion. The detail is written to `<project>_net10.0_x64.log` under
`bin/Release/net10.0/TestResults/`, which is **never uploaded as an artifact** and dies with the
runner. The file is **UTF-16LE with a BOM**, so a plain `cat` in a workflow prints garbled spaced-out
text; `iconv -f UTF-16 -t UTF-8` recovers it cleanly, yielding the `failed <Type>.<Method>` line, the
assertion, expected/actual, and the stack.

**Why 6.2.41's pre-push review missed it.** That review verified test *counts* were identical before
and after the migration, which was true and is what it claimed. **Every run in the sweep was green,
so the failure path was never exercised once.** It checked that passing still worked and never
checked that failing still reported. A migration changes both paths; verifying one is half a
verification. **This is the same family as the three rules below** — the check that was run was the
one with a command attached, and the one that mattered had never been written down at all.

**Not yet filed, pending the operator's call:** the diagnosability regression, whose fix is a few
lines in `ci.yml` and `nightly.yml` dumping the log through `iconv` when a project fails, and the
#246 recurrence. A fresh issue is the honest form for the latter — reopening #246 would assert it was
the same test, which is precisely what can no longer be proven.

**Previously, 2026-09-12 — at the merge, as the previous seven were.** 6.2.41 merged as #567;
this entry was written from the session that built it, on `chore/6241-merged`.

**THE PHASE'S PREMISE WAS FALSE AND TESTING IS WHAT SHOWED IT.** 6.2.41 existed to unblock #314.
It does not: `TestingPlatformDotnetTestSupport` opts into the VSTest *bridge*, and MTP 2.3.3 removed
the bridge. The bump built clean and then ran **nothing** — 77 of 77 projects, no test output. On SDK
10.0.401 neither `global.json` runner value works; `"MicrosoftTestingPlatform"` is rejected by the
SDK's own CLI parser. **#314 is blocked on SDK support, not on this repository**, and the diagnosis
posted there earlier — which said the opposite — was corrected on the PR rather than left standing.
The migration shipped anyway, on its own merits, after re-asking because the justification had
changed.

**THE BEIR CACHE WAS PROVISIONED AND I DID NOT SOURCE `env.sh`. THIRD TIME.** This file already
carried the note — *"source its env.sh BEFORE writing 'unprovisioned' anywhere; two sessions have now
called it missing when it was there"* — and it happened again. Sourcing it took
`Embeddings.Onnx.Tests` from **10 skips to 0**. Consequence for 6.2.41: both sweeps ran unprovisioned,
so the before/after comparison is sound (same state twice) but **~118 of the benchmark project's 267
tests never executed under either runner**. Verification is project-granular, not test-granular, and
CI will not close that gap because CI runs unprovisioned too. **Closed the same day by re-running that
project provisioned under MTP: 175 passed / 92 skipped / 0 failed, against 149/118 unprovisioned —
26 more tests executed, all passing.** The residual 92 are budget-, secret- or capability-gated.

**Three rules were recorded in this file and then broken by the session that recorded them**, which
is the thing worth carrying forward more than any individual finding:

1. *Enumerate suites, do not reason about which are safe to skip* — then 6.2.40 asserted a test
   project did not exist.
2. *Commitlint caps headers at 100 and lints every commit a PR adds* — then a 104-character header
   failed CI on #567, on a commit that was not the tip.
3. *Source `env.sh` before writing "unprovisioned"* — then both 6.2.41 sweeps ran unprovisioned.

**The pattern is not missing rules. It is that prose rules are not checked at the moment they
apply.** What worked in 6.2.41 was the count-keyed comparison and the `git diff` constraint check —
both mechanical. What failed was everything expressed as advice. Prefer a command or a guard over a
sentence.

**Milestone 6 is back to two remaining phases, both account-blocked** — 6.1 and 6.3. **Locally
finishable:** #184 (breaking, pre-1.0 is the moment), #559 and #560 from 6.2.40, the ~118 unverified
benchmark tests above, and AI.Sentinel #205 in the other repository. **#314 stays open**, correctly
attributed; worth muting if it will keep failing, since a permanently red dependency PR is what
started this.

**Previously, 2026-09-12 — at the merge, as the previous six were.** 6.2.40 merged as #561 at
20:23 on 2026-09-11; this entry was written from the session that built it, on `chore/6240-merged`.

**THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE IN ONE WEEK, AND WRITING THE RULE DOWN DID NOT PREVENT THE SECOND.**
6.2.39's plan reasoned that a markdown-only change could affect no other suite and skipped
`pack-validate`; CI caught it. 6.2.40's plan then asserted "`Rag.NET.Security` has no test project of
its own" — it has 16 files and 104 tests — **two paragraphs below its own constraint saying to
enumerate suites rather than reason about which are safe to skip.**

**The lesson is not "write the constraint down".** It was written down, in the same document, and
restated in the Global Constraints. It still failed. The operative difference in 6.2.40 was that
`pack-validate` *was* run locally, because that step had a command attached to it rather than a
principle. **A constraint expressed as a rule gets reasoned around; the same constraint expressed as
a command in a task step gets executed.** Future plans should list the suites to run as literal
commands, never as "the affected suites".

**Two findings came from reading implementations rather than method names**, which is now three
phases running that this discipline has paid out. `TrustLevelRetrievalGuard` treats absent
`trust_level` metadata as `internal`, a second fail-open default the posture had not mentioned; and
query sanitisation does not apply to `RetrieveAsync`, which is defensible but recorded nowhere — no
doc comment, no test, no page. Documented and filed as **#559**, not changed, because a behaviour
change does not belong in a PR reviewed as documentation. **#560** filed for the other 52 ✅ Done
entries in `features.md`, one of which turned out to be a design proposal marked Done.

**Milestone 6 is back to two remaining phases, both account-blocked** — 6.1 and 6.3. **Locally
finishable and still open:** #184 (breaking, pre-1.0 is the moment), #314 (xunit v4, red since
2026-08-18), #559 and #560 from this phase, and AI.Sentinel #205 in the other repository.

**Eight stale local branches are being kept deliberately** — the operator declined deletion on
2026-09-11 after all eight were verified present on `main` by content. Do not re-propose it.

**Previously, 2026-09-11 — at the merge, as the previous five were.** 6.2.39 merged as #556;
this entry was written from the session that built it, on `chore/6239-merged`.

**THE LESSON FROM 6.2.39 IS ABOUT CHOOSING A TEST SET, AND IT WILL RECUR.** The plan ran
`RepoConventions` plus the docs build, reasoning that a markdown-only change affects no other suite.
`pack-validate` failed on the PR: `DocsCodeExamplesTests` requires every C# example on a published
page to resolve against what the produced packages actually ship. **"No `src/` change" is not "no
suite affected"** — this repository validates its *documentation against its packages*, so a
docs-only change is precisely the kind that breaks packaging validation. The repository's own note
that `dotnet build` cannot reach the `pack-validate` guards was already on file and was not applied.
**The rule to carry: enumerate the suites, do not reason about which ones could not possibly be
affected.** That reasoning has now failed twice this week in different directions.

**Two phases in a row have found their own design or plan wrong before shipping**, which is the
process working rather than a run of bad luck: 6.2.38's design claimed documentation guards covered
`docs/guide/` and nothing did; 6.2.39's plan predicted an error message would strand a reader when it
in fact names the fix imperatively. Both corrections are struck through in place rather than
rewritten away.

**AI.Sentinel #205 filed** — `AddAISentinel` is not idempotent, and that package's own README
named-pipeline example builds a detection pipeline holding 165 detectors instead of 55. Found while
testing whether it composes with Rag.NET at the `IChatClient` boundary; the composition itself works
and is now documented. **The first report of this was wrong** and blamed a call of mine; the issue and
the PR body were both corrected to the real cause rather than left standing.

**Milestone 6 is back to two remaining phases, both account-blocked** — 6.1 and 6.3. **What is still
locally finishable is unchanged and is not nothing**: #552 (the security guide omits prompt-injection
defences, the risk `features.md` calls primary), #184 (breaking, pre-1.0 is the moment), #314 (xunit
v4, red since 2026-08-18), and nine stale local branches. That list came from this file's own
*"what is actually open"* section, which a session two days ago claimed was empty without reading it.

**Previously, 2026-09-11 — at the merge, as the previous four were.** 6.2.38 merged as #553
and this entry was written from the session that built it, on `chore/6238-merged`. A follow-up #554
carried one line that phase's own `git add` missed: the posture's link to #552 was edited and never
staged, because the commit named directories instead of the files actually changed. The PR body
claimed the link was there. **Found by reading `git status`, not by anything systematic**, and worth
recording because staging by directory will do it again.

**6.2.38 produced 6.2.39 by making an omission visible, which is the posture earning its keep.**
Writing down what the library defends showed that **all four of its security points act before the
model is called** and nothing acts after — `IConfidenceScorer` scores groundedness, not whether a
response leaked a credential the model saw in a chunk. 6.2.39 documents the `IChatClient`
composition that covers it, taking on no code and no dependency.

**AI.Sentinel was assessed on its merits and the version skew was measured rather than assumed.** It
is the operator's own package; a throwaway spike forcing this repository's pins against it — two
majors apart on `ZeroAlloc.Mediator` and `ValueObjects` — showed 55 detectors resolve and construct
and a scan runs clean of `MissingMethodException`. **The spike also found a blatant injection
scanning clean in a bare configuration**, almost certainly a missing `EmbeddingGenerator`; reported
to its author rather than chased, and the reason 6.2.39 will tell readers to verify detection
against their own configuration.

**Previously, 2026-09-10 — four times in one day, all four at the merge, and that one
corrected the entry before it.** 6.2.37 merged as #549 at 20:16 and this entry was written from the
session that built it, on `chore/6237-merged` cut immediately after. The mechanism holds.

**THE PREVIOUS ENTRY WAS WRONG, AND THE LIST THAT CONTRADICTS IT IS IN THIS FILE.** It said 6.2.36
left "every locally-finishable item in this milestone done" and that "the next action belongs to the
operator rather than to a session". Both were false when written. The section headed *"What is
actually open, in the order worth taking it"* — further down this same document — names three items
that are local, unblocked and unscheduled, and it was not read. **The failure was not the claim, it
was the reading**: a 120 KB state file was opened at the top handoff and at the structured sections,
and a list two-thirds of the way down was never reached. Recorded here rather than quietly fixed,
because the same shape will recur on the next long file.

**What that list actually names, re-verified 2026-09-10 after 6.2.37:**

1. **The security-position document.** `docs/guide/security.md` documents security *features* — RBAC,
   PII redaction, audit log. Nothing states the project's **posture**: threat model, what is in and
   out of scope, the dependency position. **And there is no `SECURITY.md`**, so 71 published NuGet
   packages have no vulnerability-disclosure path. Fully local. Scoped as 6.2.38.
2. **#184** — the fluent bootstrapping entry point. Breaking, and pre-1.0 is the moment for it.
   Appears in neither ROADMAP nor MILESTONE, which is a record-then-schedule violation of its own.
3. **#314** — the xunit-dotnet v4 major bump. Three build legs plus `pack-validate` red since
   2026-08-18, rebased and still red.

**The five Dependabot alerts remain correctly triaged and mostly unfixable**, re-confirmed against
the API 2026-09-10: `image-size` and `nltk` (both high) have no patch and live in the Docusaurus
build and the Python comparison harness; `qs` (medium) is patched at 6.16.0 and enters via
`webpack-dev-server`, reaching only `npm start`. **None is in a shipped NuGet package's closure.**
The one fixable entry has been a one-line `overrides` fix since 2026-09-07 and is folded into 6.2.38
rather than left as a fourth open item.

**Previously, 2026-09-10 — three times in one day, all three at the merge, and that entry
overstated what was left.** 6.2.36 merged as #545 at 17:55 and this entry was written
from the same session that built it, on `chore/6236-merged` cut immediately after. The mechanism is
unchanged and is still the only thing carrying it — the session that built the phase records the
merge as its next action, so no window opens. **Three is a pattern where two was not**, and the
thing to notice is that no session yet has had to *discover* a stale entry since the mechanism
started. The two previous entries follow below unchanged.

**With 6.2.36 closed, every locally-finishable item in Milestone 6 is done.** What remains — 6.1
Recorded Responses and 6.3 Release v1.0 — is blocked on accounts, not on effort, and has been since
2026-08-20. **That is a different kind of state than this file has held before**: there is no next
phase to start, and the next action belongs to the operator rather than to a session. The honest
next step is a decision (acquire the accounts, record the cassettes, or revisit the 2026-08-20 call
that keeps 6.1 gating the tag), not a plan.

**The one thing 6.2.36 leaves open, and it is not blocked:** #544. `ResilientVectorStore` still does
not implement `IHybridSearchable`, so registering `Rag.NET.Resilience` disables native hybrid
dispatch entirely — and now that the ranker lives on that path, it silently disables semantic ranking
too. 6.2.36 shipped a warning for it and no fix, deliberately. **It is fully finishable locally** and
is the only such item left; it has no phase number, which by this repository's record-then-schedule
rule means it should get one before it is worked.

**Previously, 2026-09-10 — twice in one day, both at the merge.** 6.2.35 merged as #540 at
13:04 and this entry was written from the same session, as was 6.2.34's before it. **Two is not a
habit**, and the mechanism is still the only thing carrying it: the session that built the phase
records the merge as its next action, so no window opens. The first such entry, written this morning,
follows below unchanged.

**Previously, 2026-09-10 — written within the hour of the merge it records, which is the one
thing every entry below says never happens.** 6.2.34 merged as #536 at 10:02; this entry was written
from the same session, on the `chore/state-6234-merged` branch cut immediately after. **The streak
is broken by mechanism, not by resolve:** the session that built the phase recorded the merge as its
next action, so there was no window in which the file could go stale. Every prior occurrence
below was written by a *later* session discovering the gap. Whether it holds depends on the next
session doing the same, not on this note.

**Previously, 2026-09-09 — THIRTEEN MORE PHASES SHIPPED AND THIS FILE RECORDED NONE OF THEM.**
6.2.18–6.2.30 are all on `main`. That is the fifth time this document has gone stale at a merge, and
the note below — written on the fourth — did not prevent the fifth. **The entry that follows was
itself two days out of date while claiming to correct staleness.** The habit that fails is writing
`STATE.md` at the *session* boundary; the merges happen inside sessions and nobody is editing this
file at the moment a PR lands. `ROADMAP.md` and `MILESTONE.md` stayed current throughout — they are
edited by `complete-phase`, which runs per phase, and this file is not.

**#318 CLOSED 2026-09-09: seven remote stores, seven distinct mechanisms.** 6.2.24–6.2.30 gave
PgVector (`unnest` zips the pairs), Qdrant (payload filter — its point ids are random GUIDs), Redis
(direct hash read; the key *is* the identity), Weaviate (GraphQL `where`), Pinecone (`Fetch` on a
derived id), Chroma (needed a `/get` endpoint added — `/query` cannot serve a keyed read at all) and
Azure AI Search (`GetDocument`, after replacing a random GUID key). **Not one was a translation of
the last**, which is why they were read individually rather than copied after the second diverged.

**~~One test caught the same mutation on all seven backends and nothing else did.~~ Retracted
2026-09-09, in the phase that tried to make it eight.** This entry claimed the negative-index test
was the only thing catching an unsigned `chunk_index`, seven for seven. **6.2.31's mutation sweep
applied that mutation to Redis's shared `KeyFor` helper and nothing caught it** — one helper serves
both the write and the read, so the change is self-consistent, and the existing test's indices
(`-1, -2, 0`) share no magnitude.

**The streak is not disproved; it is unverifiable.** 6.2.26 recorded the same mutation on the same
store as caught, and at that commit `KeyFor` was already shared and the test data already identical.
So either that phase mutated the stored `chunk_index` field — a different site, genuinely caught —
or it mutated the helper and recorded a result nobody ran. **Nothing in the record names the line**,
so it cannot be told from here. The lesson is the actionable half: **a mutation's site decides how
strong the test is**, and naming the mutation without naming the line makes a sweep unreproducible.
Record the site from here on. `ROADMAP.md`'s 6.2.31 block carries the full reasoning.

**Scoping the last backend found a worse defect than the missing feature (#517).**
`AzureAISearchVectorStore` assigned `Guid.NewGuid()` as the document key, so `Upload` could never
replace: re-ingesting duplicated every chunk, measured on the simulator, and **no test had ever
stored anything twice** — a store-then-search test passes either way. The lookup was blocked by the
same root cause. **Two symptoms, one cause, and the feature request is what exposed it.**

**Previously, 2026-09-07 — the note that did not hold:** **FIVE PHASES SHIPPED SINCE 6.2.1 CLOSED,
AND THIS FILE RECORDED NONE OF THEM UNTIL NOW.** 6.2.13-6.2.17 are all on `main`: the MCP write
surface (#198), the RAPTOR leaf purge (#338), the corpus-tree BM25 accumulation (#336), the GMM
variance floor (#337, partly), and the BM25 doc-id allocator (#490, closing #487). **The tail of
this file still said #336 and #338 "remain open by decision" while both were closed.** That is the
fourth time this document has gone stale at a merge — the exact failure its own Working State
section was rewritten to prevent, reappearing in a section that rewrite does not cover.

**One defect shape accounts for four of the five.** Code that succeeds while doing nothing: a
swallowed exception, a duplicate id that returns, a rebuilder that never calls BM25, a `Use*` nobody
invoked. None of them failed; all of them lied, and every one was found by running something rather
than by reading. **Where a guard is cheap, prefer a throw to a tolerant return** — #490 was silent
data loss precisely because the collision path was `return`.

**Previously, 2026-09-06:** **6.2.1 NOW OWNS NO ALLOWLIST ENTRIES.** All four LLM-funded
entries are discharged: Self-Query and LLM Metadata Extraction on the 5th, Deep Research, Mind-Map
and Conversational Memory on the 6th. The phase's exit condition is met on every clause it owns;
what remains on `SectionsAwaitingExercise` belongs to 6.1 and 6.2. **Two lessons outrank the
figures.** (1) A cache is a spend ledger nothing reads — count it before quoting a cost; the
metadata run's $4.63 had already been paid. (2) **Fail-open code makes a benchmark lie quietly**:
deep research reproduced its control exactly with zero model calls, and only a mechanism guard
caught it. Every LLM-driven cell now carries one.

(Previously: THE TECHNIQUE SWEEP IS COMPLETE — five techniques, three corpora each,
fifteen cells, every figure pinned and reproduced on an idle machine. What remains of the phase is
**three** allowlist entries, all LLM-funded — Self-Query and **LLM Metadata Extraction** are both
measured and discharged. **A cache is a spend ledger nothing here reads**: the metadata run's
$4.63 had already been paid by an earlier session that ended without committing the cell or the
figure, and the only thing that caught it was a never-run cell reporting 20,155 hits and 0 misses)
**Written by:** `project-orchestration` — first `STATE.md` this project has had. Milestones 1–5 ran
without one, which is why every session so far re-derived its position from `ROADMAP.md` and
`MILESTONE.md` and twice acted on a debt that had already closed.

## Session handoff — 2026-09-10, end of session

**Written by `pause-work`.** Six PRs merged today (#536, #537, #540, #541, #542) and one phase closed
that nobody planned this morning.

### Current position

**Milestone 6, active.** No phase is open. **6.2.36 is scoped and not started** — design and roadmap
entry are on `main` (#542); there is **no implementation plan yet**.

Closed today: **6.2.34** the semantic ranker (#536), **6.2.35** the benchmark filter guard (#540).
Both recorded at the merge rather than after the drift, which is the first time that has happened
twice in a row.

### Open decisions — the next session must not re-litigate these

Three were settled by the operator today and are **not open**, though a reader could mistake them
for open because the design records the alternatives:

- **6.2.36 moves the ranker to `HybridSearchAsync`.** Not "make it unconfigurable", not "revert".
- **`EnsembleBehavior` throws** when ranking is enabled and the native path is unreachable. Not warn,
  not document-only.
- **Pre-push review reports are not committed.** They live on disk untracked, deliberately.

Genuinely open, and named in the 6.2.36 design for the plan to settle:

- **Does `AzureAISearchVectorStore` keep `IScoreScaleAware`?** Once the ranker leaves the dense path
  it returns `Similarity` unconditionally, which `ScoreScale`'s own remarks define as the assumed
  default for stores that do *not* implement it. Keep as a discoverable declaration, or remove as
  vestigial.
- **What the general `IHybridSearchable` capability probe is called**, and its exact shape.
  6.2.33's defaulted `HybridScoreScale` is the precedent.
- **Whether 6.2.36 ships before or after the resilience fix below**, or whether its throw message
  names resilience as a known cause.

### Blockers, and one open loop that is nobody's yet

- **6.1 and 6.3 are blocked on accounts, not effort.** Unchanged since 2026-08-20. 6.2.36 is the only
  remaining item that can be finished locally.
- **THE RESILIENCE / HYBRID FINDING IS NOT FILED.** `ResilientVectorStore` does not implement
  `IHybridSearchable`, and `EnsembleBehavior` probes the decorated `IVectorStore`, so **enabling
  resilience silently disables native hybrid dispatch today** for every store that supports it —
  independent of the ranker, and shipped. It is written up in the 6.2.36 design's §4 and in the
  ROADMAP block, **and it has no issue number.** The operator was asked and the session ended before
  an answer. **This is the one thing in this handoff that exists only in prose.**

### Recommended next step

**Merge state permitting, run `writing-plans` for 6.2.36** — the design is complete, the decisions
are settled, and the only inputs it needs are the three open questions above. Then
`list-phase-assumptions` → `executing-plans`.

**Before that, decide the resilience issue.** If it is filed, 6.2.36's plan should reference it; if
it is not, 6.2.36's throw will surface it as an unexplained failure for any user with resilience
registered.

### Environment left running

**Docker Desktop was started by this session** and is still running. Nothing depends on it between
sessions; stop it freely.

## Current Position

**Milestone:** 6 — Hardening & v1.0 — Battle-Tested (active since 2026-08-15)
**Phase:** 6.2.35 — A Filter That Filters Nothing — **MERGED 2026-09-10** (#540, `08f39f9f`),
closing #529. Verified on `main` by content — `Directory.Build.targets` exists,
`RefuseVSTestFilterUnderTestingPlatform`, `RAGNET0001` and
`TheGuardIsHookedToTheTestingPlatformRunner` are all present — not by the PR's MERGED label.
**No phase is currently open**, and **what remains of the milestone is blocked on accounts, not
effort**: 6.1's cassettes and the 6.3 tag that waits on them.

**A TOOL THAT LIED, FIXED WITH THE SAME POSTURE AS THE LIBRARY DEFECTS.** `--filter` on the
benchmark project set a VSTest property Microsoft.Testing.Platform does not read: MTP warned and ran
**267** tests instead of the one class asked for, 149 of them for real. The platform already
detected the condition and already declined to act on it — **the whole defect was that its response
was a warning where the consequence is a wrong answer.** The phase changed a severity, not a
detection.

**The issue's arithmetic was wrong by nearly 4x and its scope claim was right.** It said "~70". Both
halves were checked rather than assumed, because 6.2.32 found #521 naming three vector stores when
there were six sites.

**The phase's own sweep prediction was wrong, and naming the error is the point.** Row 4 swaps the
condition for the property — the tidy a future reader is most likely to make, because it makes the
condition match the message. It was predicted to survive as *"behaviourally equivalent today"*. It is
not equivalent in any respect: **the condition asks whether a filter was passed; the property asks
whether the project uses MTP.** Swapping them makes the guard fire on every unfiltered run. **The
reasoning conflated a coincidence of scope — one project sets the property — with equivalence of
meaning.** Those are unrelated, and the mistake is the kind that survives review because both
statements are true.

**Row 3 is the one that justified writing a second kind of test, and it held exactly as argued in
advance.** Deleting `BeforeTargets` left both behavioural tests green while the guard never ran,
because invoking a target by name bypasses the hook. **A harness that cannot reach a thing cannot
guard it** — worth remembering the next time a structural assertion looks redundant beside a
behavioural one.

**The review found a hang-shaped risk inside the guard for a property that exists because of a
hang.** The helper read one redirected stream to the end and then the other, and waited unbounded.
Unlikely with one MSBuild target — but `TestingPlatformDotnetTestSupport` is in this repository
**because of #275, a deadlock in test infrastructure that hung 2 of 4 runs before entering test
code**, so probability was not the argument. **The repository already held both the weaker pattern
and the better one** (`ProducedPackageTests` reads sequentially; `CliProcessTests.RunAsync` reads
async with a bounded wait) **and the branch had reached for the weaker.** When two patterns exist,
check which one you copied.

**Two things only running it would have found.** The analyzer rejects `==` on strings. And **an XML
comment cannot contain a double hyphen**, which is genuinely awkward in a file whose entire subject
is a command-line flag spelled with one — the comment names the MSBuild property instead and says
why, so the next editor does not re-break it.

**Previously:** 6.2.34 — The Semantic Ranker, and the Simulator That Lies About It — **MERGED 2026-09-10**
(#536, `f5870bdf`), closing #328. Verified on `main` by content — `EnableSemanticRanking`,
`SemanticConfigurationName`, `SearchIndexSettle` and `EnablingTheRankerWithKJustBelowFiftyIsRejected`
are all present — not by the PR's MERGED label. **No phase is currently open.** The next planned
phase is 6.3 Release v1.0, still blocked on 6.1, still blocked on accounts.

**A FEATURE SHIPPED *WITH* ITS UNVERIFIABILITY RATHER THAN WAITING FOR A RESOURCE.** The Azure
simulator accepts a semantic index configuration and `queryType=semantic`, returns HTTP 200 with
results, and returns **no `rerankerScore` at all**. So the store throws when ranking was requested
and none comes back. That guard is what makes the feature shippable — and it is also what makes
everything past it untestable, because the guard fires before any of it runs.

**The mutation sweep inverted two of its own predictions, and that is the transferable part.** Row 6
— leak the ranker into `HybridSearchAsync` — was flagged in the plan as the one *"nothing may
catch"*; it failed two existing tests. Row 7 — apply `MinScore` on the ranked path — survived and
**cannot be closed by any local test**: the line is *unreachable*, not untested. **A predicted gap
that turns out closed is worth recording as loudly as one that turns out open.** The prediction was
the guess; the sweep is the evidence. The design's §5 was rewritten from that result rather than
left as written.

**The one real gap the sweep found was in the plan's own test code, not the implementation.** The
`k` guard was tested at 10 (reject) and 50 (accept), so a threshold mutated from 50 to 11 passed
every test while wrongly accepting **49** — the exact value the guidance is about. **A boundary
tested only from far outside it is not tested.** Same shape as 6.2.31's fused-score test that could
not fail.

**Two guards this repository owns that `dotnet build` cannot reach, both hit this session.**
`PackageValidation` compares packed artefacts against the version GitVersion derives — stale
artefacts from an *earlier branch* failed it, needing a full 73-package repack. And
`EveryDocsCodeExampleResolvesAgainstTheProducedPackages` compiles every fenced `csharp` block under
`docs/` against the shipped packages, **scanning the filesystem rather than git**, so an *untracked*
file breaks it too: the phase's own pre-push review report did, quoting a test line containing
xunit's `TestContext`. **Run `pack-validate`'s suites before pushing anything that touches a
`.csproj` or adds a docs page.**

**Pre-push review reports are deliberately not committed.** The 2026-09-09 pair and this phase's own
are untracked, and #536 briefly tracked one before it was amended back out — committing them adds a
`docs/` page that must satisfy the docs-example guard forever, for no benefit. **Established
practice, now written down** because nothing recorded it and the skill's default is to commit.

**Previously:** 6.2.33 — A Fused Score Is Not a Similarity — **MERGED 2026-09-09** (#531, `5d62f58b`),
closing #530. Verified on `main` by content: the new `HybridScoreScale` member, both stores'
`minScore: 0.0` on their hybrid paths, the new dense guard test, and `CanDispatchNatively`'s
predicate unchanged. **#328 split out to 6.2.34** — on verifiability, not size.

**THE SEVERITY WAS WRONG WHEN FILED AND THE RECORD SAYS SO.** #530 was filed claiming a live
wrong-results defect: two stores apply a similarity-shaped `MinScore` to backend-fused hybrid
scores. **`EnsembleBehavior.CanDispatchNatively` already requires `MinScore is 0.0`**, so the
pipeline never hands them a threshold — it takes the client-side path instead. Checked only because
this same guide once claimed "filtering happens in the pipeline" about metadata and was false. **The
lesson is the checking, not the guard**: the correction landed in the issue, the design and the
roadmap before any code was written.

**Two findings the phase produced that nobody asked for.** The mutation sweep's survivor was a
**control** mutation on a path the phase does not touch — Azure's *dense* `MinScore` had no test at
all, while Weaviate's was already covered. And the whole-branch review found **`IHybridSearchable`'s
own summary contradicting the member it had just gained**, thirty lines apart in one file.

**Previously:** 6.2.32 — A Corrupt Blob Is Not an Empty One — **MERGED 2026-09-09** (#527, `f9ad2f04`),
closing #521. Verified on `main` by content: the shared `DeserializeMetadataOrThrow` is in 11 files
and **zero callers of the raw `DeserializeMetadata`/`DeserializeTags` remain outside the
serializer** — the invariant the phase created holds on `main`, not just on the branch.

**THE POSTURE THAT WON HAD NO TEST, AND THAT IS THE FINDING.** Weaviate has thrown on a corrupt
metadata blob since 2026-07-25 by deliberate review decision, and nothing covered that path for six
weeks. It surfaced only because the phase went to check the two sites that already threw before
propagating their posture to six others. **Any refactor could have reverted that decision silently
and every suite would have stayed green** — the same shape as the defect being fixed, one level up.
Closed with a seventh test.

**The issue undercounted.** #521 named three vector stores; there were six sites across five
components. It missed both SQLite ones, and `SqliteDocumentStore` has two — one reading tags rather
than chunk metadata, so the swallow reached a second data type. **Read the call sites before
trusting an issue's scope**, including issues this project filed itself.

**Breaking, and free of upgrade hazard for a reason worth remembering:** null and empty already
deserialise to Success-with-empty inside the serializer, so a throw can only fire on genuinely
malformed stored JSON. The dangerous-sounding change was mechanical once that was established.

**Previously:** 6.2.31 — What Redis Never Stored, It Cannot Return — **MERGED 2026-09-09** (#522,
`6480fd07`), closing #513. Verified on `main` by content — `VerifyFilterableKeysAreIndexedAsync`,
`BuildFilterPrefix`, `ValidateFilterableKeys`, `MetadataToken` and `filterableMetadataKeys` are all
present — not by the MERGED label. 29 commits, 47 tests where the package had 16. **No phase is
currently open.** #521 remains open by design.

**Breaking, and it needs saying where an operator will see it:** an existing Redis index must be
recreated and re-ingested. Initialisation throws naming the missing attribute rather than filtering
silently against a stale schema, so the break announces itself; it does not corrupt quietly. **The phase's scope grew when scoping it found a
wrong-results defect rather than the missing feature #513 describes**: `SearchAsync` never read
`MetadataFilter`, nothing re-checks downstream, and the guide told readers the pipeline filtered
instead — it does not, and never did.

**The whole-branch review found the defect no per-task review could see.** `HashSetAsync` is a
merge, so re-ingesting a chunk that had dropped a declared metadata key left the old `md_*` field
indexed: a filter matched a chunk whose metadata no longer contained the key. Two tasks were each
right in isolation — one made the blob unconditional, the other made the per-key fields conditional
— and the seam between them was the defect. **Reproduced red before it was fixed.**

**Previously:** 6.2.30 — The Azure AI Search Key Carries Identity — **COMPLETE 2026-09-08** (#518,
`526380cf`, closing #517 and completing #318). **The next planned phase in `ROADMAP.md` is one
nothing local can start**: 6.3 Release v1.0, blocked on 6.1, blocked on accounts. Every phase since
6.2.17 has been added ad hoc from the backlog for that reason.

**Thirteen closed since 6.2.17**, none of them recorded here until 2026-09-09: **6.2.18** deep
research honours `TopK` (#475, #494 — fused by RRF rather than the issue's own suggested truncation,
which would have made retrieval worse; +0.04171 on SciFact, the largest gain any technique has had),
**6.2.19** the lonely-component rule (#337's residue — both the issue's predicted mechanism and its
characterisation were wrong, and measuring said so), **6.2.20** the Airtable benchmark discrepancy
(#207 — a recording error, not a regression: one commit published two harness modes and the mode
alone is worth 6.9x), **6.2.21** a failing vision model says so (#497, filing #504), **6.2.22** why
the empty-component rule stays (#498 — kept for cost, and **deliberately left untested** because
deleting it is invisible through every public surface), **6.2.23** `RagError.ModelCallFailed` (#504,
breaking), and **6.2.24–6.2.30** the seven keyed chunk lookups (#318, #517).

**Two of those thirteen reversed their own issue's claim, and one reversed its own fix.** 6.2.23
wrapped the two propagating model callers, measured, and **reverted the wrap**: their `IChatClient`
is often a cache opened refuse-on-miss that throws *instead of* calling the model, so the wrap
relabelled a deliberate refusal as a model failure. **The sweep caught it, not review.**

**Previously:** 6.2.17 — BM25 doc-id allocation — **COMPLETE 2026-09-07** (#491, `94a3d86d`). Five
closed since 6.2.1: **6.2.13** MCP authenticated write surface (#198, new package
`Rag.NET.Mcp.AspNetCore`, 72 -> 73), **6.2.14** RAPTOR leaf purge on delete (#338), **6.2.15**
corpus-tree BM25 accumulation (#336), **6.2.16** the GMM variance floor (#337 — the absolute `1e-6`
is fixed; the near-duplicate residue closed later, in 6.2.19), **6.2.17** BM25 doc-id allocation
(#490, closing #487).

**Previously:** 6.2.1 — Retrieval & Answer Sweep — **COMPLETE 2026-09-06.** Every exit-condition clause
met; the allowlist clause was amended the same day from "the guards' allowlist is empty" to "carries
no entry owned by this phase", with the original wording and the 47-entry count kept in `ROADMAP.md`
so the change is reviewable. **The next phase is 6.3 Release v1.0, and it is blocked on 6.1** — 18
cassettes whose blocker is accounts rather than effort, kept as a v1.0 gate by the operator's
2026-08-20 decision. Nothing in the codebase moves that.

**Previously** (active; RAPTOR Task 5 is done and pinned in #389,
**#176 closed 2026-08-26 in #405** and the **PageRank blend deleted 2026-08-27 in #408** — all four
named debts are closed and only the sweep itself remains). **RAPTOR Task 6 closed 2026-08-27 in
#412, so RAPTOR is the sweep's first completed technique** — measured, pinned, and now written down
at `VerifiedBy=benchmark`. **The pipeline-parity test's fast leg is built and green, 2026-08-27**,
satisfying the exit condition's *"the pipeline-parity test is in the fast tier"* clause; its real
leg exists but has never run on this machine (no ONNX model, no BEIR cache) and is verified by
reading only. Neither closes the phase — see `ROADMAP.md`'s 6.2.1 block for what still remains.

**2026-08-26 shipped 6.2.12 — the first external user's defects.** Seven merged PRs, all verified
on `main` by content. Its full record is in `ROADMAP.md`; the three findings worth carrying here:

1. **Silent data loss, live at shipped defaults.** `CleanupMode.Full` deletes what a run did not
   see. A provider listing failure was collected into `Errors` and dropped, so the entries behind
   it were never seen and were deleted as disappeared — **one failed sitemap page removed every
   document behind it, and the run reported success.** Fixed in #402. It is the same hazard #394
   guarded for `StopOnFirstError`, through a door that guard did not cover, so the single
   `stoppedEarly` bool became a `CleanupBlocked` reason: every way a run can fail to see an entry
   now has to be named rather than defaulting to "safe to delete".

2. **Two of the defects were caused by fixes earlier in the same phase.** #390's fix deadlocked
   Blazor (#396), and #396's fix still hung on unrelated host singletons (#400) because forwarding
   resolved *every* eligible root registration eagerly. Fixed in #403 by forwarding lazily. The
   trade was measured rather than argued: an instance descriptor is disposed 0 times by the child
   and a factory descriptor once, so laziness costs a second `Dispose` at shutdown for services the
   pipeline actually used — against a hang at startup.

3. **The reported "lock" was an unconditional sleep.** `AzureAISearchVectorStore.StoreAsync` ended
   with `await Task.Delay(1s)` — once per document, so a 500-page ingest spent over eight minutes
   asleep, buying nothing, since Azure gives no read-after-write guarantee at any fixed delay.
   Removed in #401 with a solution-wide sweep; waits that poll a real condition against a bounded
   timeout stayed.

**None of the four had a test, and the suite was green throughout** — the same shape as 6.2.3's
RAPTOR finding, where no test had ever built a tree deeper than one level. Every fix landed with a
test that fails against the previous code, mutation-checked with the mutation verified to compile
first.

**2026-08-25 moved five phases.** All verified on `main` by content rather than by a PR's MERGED
label:

| Phase | State |
| --- | --- |
| 6.2.5 — contract defects | complete, #372 / #373 / #374 |
| 6.2.6 — package boundaries | complete, #376 |
| 6.2.7 — named pipelines | complete, #381 |
| 6.2.8 — requested DX | complete, #378 (three of four items; #353 split into 6.2.10) |
| 6.2.9 — `Umap.Fit` at corpus scale | complete, #382 |
| 6.2.10 — vector-store initialisation | complete, branch `feat/353-vector-store-init` |
| 6.2.11 — HTML structure and a Guid seam | complete, #385 / #386 |
| 6.2.12 — dogfooding defects | complete, #391 / #397 / #398 / #399 / #401 / #402 / #403 |

**Issue sweep, 2026-08-25.** Every open issue checked against `main` by content. **#365** (Tool
message) and **#354** (Azure Document Intelligence cassette) were done and are now closed with the
evidence. **#355** is half done — `Failed` shipped, fail-fast never implemented or answered, and the
issue now carries a question rather than an assumption. **#328 is correctly open**: its commit title
says `(#328)` but the merged fix was `KNearestNeighborsCount`, and the semantic ranker it actually
asks for was deliberately split off pending the score-scale decision. A commit naming an issue is
not evidence the issue is done.

**The roadmap had all of 6.2.5, 6.2.6 and 6.2.8 still marked `pending` while their code was already
on `main`** — corrected 2026-08-25. Statuses are written when a phase is planned and nobody is
editing this file at the moment its PR merges, which is the same failure the Working State branch
field has now had three times.

**Last completed:** **`mapreduce` measured and pinned at 0.6483, 2026-08-31 — a null result, and the
DoD's answer-engine clause now closes.** Both controls held on the run (`dense` 0.3499 / 0.2603 /
0.3242, `chatengine` exactly its pinned 0.6341, both replaying from cache), so nothing drifted.
**`mapreduce − chatengine` = +0.0142, McNemar p=0.2955 on 462 wins against 430 — not significant.**
The map/reduce mechanism buys nothing measurable over a single call on this corpus; a feature
measured and found unremarkable is a completion, as 5.2 was. **The 400-query subset put the same
difference at +0.0340**, which would have read as a win: earlier pilot-to-scale misses moved a
magnitude, this one moves the conclusion — **a subset can carry a direction and cannot carry a
significance.** Contract compliance 2,553/2,556, up from 2,333. `UnmeasuredEngineArms` is now
**empty**: every arm carries a figure, reached through three separate failures of the guard that each
named the arm and the list to update. Third timing miss too — 30 minutes against a projected 6.4
hours. Full account in `docs/plans/2026-08-31-mapreduce-refusal-filter-findings.md`.

Before it, **the MapReduce refusal-filter defect, found and fixed 2026-08-31 — and it
overturns what the sweep concluded about that engine.** MapReduce drops `not found` partials by an
**exact** match before the reduce; a caller system prompt that reshapes replies defeats it, so under
the extraction contract refusals arrived as `Not found. The answer to the question is "not found".`,
survived the filter, and the reduce **discarded the one correct partial** as contradicted. A logged
transcript shows a map returning `The answer to the question is "Microsoft".` and the reduce throwing
it away. Fixed by appending a map protocol after the caller's prompt on **map calls only**; two
fast-tier regression tests, mutation-checked. **Validated on 400 queries: `mapreduce` 0.1898 →
0.6487, contract compliance to 400/400, "not found" answers from the majority to 1 of 353, and
`mapreduce − chatengine` = +0.0340** — ahead of the single-shot control rather than 0.43 behind.
**This retires the "apparatus failure / cannot be measured / per-chunk calls extract rather than
answer" reading**, which was elaborate and wrong; it was one defect. **The DoD clause is now
closable** — MapReduce was the only blocker. **Not yet pinned**: 400 queries is validation, and the
pin needs the full 2,556. **And `refine`'s pinned −0.1055 needs re-examination** — it shares the
per-chunk shape that just hid a 0.46 defect. Full account in
`docs/plans/2026-08-31-mapreduce-refusal-filter-findings.md`.

Before it, **the full answer-engine sweep on the corrected apparatus, 2026-08-30 — two clean
findings, and the phase's first real engine result.** 15,336 records, 5.5 hours, 18 tests / 0 failed.
**Gate 0 held on all three rules** (`dense` reproduced 0.3499 / 0.2603 / 0.3242 exactly).
**(1) Sequential refinement is significantly worse than answering once** — `refine − chatengine` =
**−0.1055**, `p<0.0001`, 132 wins against 370, on an uncontaminated comparison (identical prompt, path
and passes). **(2) FLARE's lookahead helps by under a percentage point** — `flare − flarefixed` =
**+0.0075**, p=0.0135, the only direct measurement of FLARE's mechanism. Labelled not-clean: the
FLARE arms' ~+0.11 over `chatengine` is confounded by a post-loop formatting call no other arm gets,
and `chatengine − dense` = +0.2843 is one sentence of prompt. **Pinned:** `chatengine` 0.6341,
`refine` 0.5286, `flarefixed` 0.7428, `flare` 0.7503. **`mapreduce` is not pinned** — it ran, and its
figure measures a known-broken setup. **Two of three named engines now have a figure with a control;
the DoD clause is still not met.** Full account in
`docs/plans/2026-08-30-answer-engine-sweep-results.md`.

Before it, **the contract split three ways by granularity, and its 400-query validation,
2026-08-30 — four arms became comparable and `mapreduce` was proven not measurable here.** Grounding
to every arm, abstention to `dense` alone, terminal extraction reaching FLARE only after assembly.
**`PromptTemplate`'s byte-identity is proven**: `dense` returned 0.3484 / 0.2635 / 0.3201 with
222/353 and 21/47 abstentions, identical to the previous subset digit for digit, replayed wholly from
cache — pin and Gate 0 intact. Against a properly-instructed `chatengine` control: `flare` +0.1417,
`flarefixed` +0.1332, `refine` −0.0680, `mapreduce` −0.4249; FLARE moved for the first time now that
grounding reaches it. **`mapreduce` stays broken for a structural reason** — grounding is no more
portable to per-chunk maps than abstention was, because those calls *extract facts* rather than
answer the question, so no "answer the question" instruction fits them. Third instance of the
granularity class, and the one proving it is not about any particular rule. **A clean full sweep on
this basis does NOT close the DoD clause**, which names MapReduce among the three engines. Full
account in `docs/plans/2026-08-30-engine-granularity-findings.md`.

Before it, **the engine contract fix and its first 400-query validation subset, 2026-08-30 — it
fixed two arms, broke a third and missed a fourth.** `AnswerContract` names all three of
`PromptTemplate`'s instructions and `EngineAnswerOptions` passes the whole of it; `PromptTemplate`
composes to the same bytes so `dense`'s cache and pin survive. **For `chatengine`, `mapreduce` and
`refine` it worked** — abstentions appeared where there had been none (0 of 301 before, 13-26 of 47
now) and `chatengine − dense` collapsed from **+0.4204 to −0.1104**. **But `mapreduce` fell to
0.0142**, answering the literal `"not found"`: the abstention rule reaches its per-chunk maps, and a
single chunk lacks the answer even when six together contain it. **And the FLARE arms never received
the contract at all** (0 of 47) — a gap in #419's own Task 4. **The finding, named as a class:
there is no single instruction string that means the same thing to a single-shot engine and to one
that decomposes its context.** Fifth occurrence of that shape in this phase. The 400-query subset
cost ~$3 against ~$20 and found three problems, two of them new. Full account in
`docs/plans/2026-08-30-engine-contract-subset-findings.md`.

Before it, **the full 2,556-query answer-engine sweep, 2026-08-30 — it ran, and its accuracy
figures are not an engine comparison.** 15,336 records, 6.5 hours, 15 tests / 0 failed / 0 skipped.
**Gate 0 held exactly** — `dense` reproduced its pinned 0.3499 / 0.2603 / 0.3242 to four decimals, so
the corpora did not diverge and the run is sound. Then the control moved: `chatengine` shares
`dense`'s retrieval verbatim yet scored **+0.4204 paper and −0.0541 raw** against it. The cause is
that **`PromptTemplate` carries three instructions — grounding, abstention, extraction — and
`EngineAnswerOptions` passes only the third**; #418 found one of three. `dense` abstains on 61.8% of
answerable queries because it was told to, and **every engine arm abstains 0 of 301 on the
unanswerable ones**, five times over. Nothing is pinned; the DoD's answer-engine clause is still
unmet. The re-run is deferred — see Recommended Next Step. Full account in
`docs/plans/2026-08-30-answer-engine-sweep-findings.md`.

Before it, **the FLARE contract-and-cache fix, 2026-08-29, merged to `main` as `50221812`
in #419** — #418 (merged to `main`
2026-08-29 as `e7563873`) gave every engine arm the judge's extraction contract and broke FLARE doing
it: a terminal `SystemPrompt` fighting FLARE's own one-sentence-at-a-time protocol produced an
86,091-byte runaway (23× the historical maximum), reachable because `CachedGraphRagClient` also
discarded FLARE's `MaxOutputTokens` guard. **The third time in this phase a fix has caused the next
defect** (6.2.12 had #390 → #396 → #400). Five commits (`d8b86bba`..`1d9f4f2b`) fix FLARE's fragment
protocol, the cache key (new optional field, omitted not emptied, zero regeneration across 86,510
entries), the client's option-forwarding, and the harness's contract application. A re-run pilot,
2026-08-29 — 15 tests, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 469 new cache entries — found every engine arm meeting the
extraction contract on 8 or 9 of 9 queries (up from 0 of 9), three arms at 8 rather than 9. **This
does not close Phase 6.2.1's answer-engine DoD clause**, which still needs the full 2,556-query sweep.
Full account in `ROADMAP.md`'s 6.2.1 block and `docs/plans/2026-08-29-flare-contract-pilot-notes.md`.

Before it, **the answer-engine arms, 2026-08-28, merged in #416 (`d2d96b0d`)** — five arms sharing
dense retrieval and varying only generation (`chatengine` the control, `mapreduce`, `refine`,
`flarefixed`, `flare`), three pilot gates (context identity, call shape, lookahead firing), and a
corrected cost model (~$4 realistic / ~$21 worst case for the 2,556-query sweep, dominated by FLARE's
sentence count). `flare` shipped with a real retriever because #414 merged mid-implementation as
`641e27f0`. A 10-query pilot then ran 2026-08-28 and found every non-`dense` arm missing the judge's
extraction contract entirely (0 of 9) — the defect #418 fixed, and the fix that broke FLARE above.
Before that, **the pipeline-parity test's fast leg, 2026-08-27** — now
merged as **#414** (`641e27f0`), verified on `main` by content (`PipelineParity.cs` present) rather
than by the PR's label — `OrderingEmbeddingGenerator`, `PipelineParity` and `PipelineParityTests`
compare a real `AddRagNet` pipeline against the harness's dense row with exact score equality; the
mutation check ran and failed with a named-rank, both-ids-and-scores message; the real SciFact leg
was written and reviewed but has never run on this machine and is verified by reading only. Before
it, **RAPTOR Task 6** (#412, 2026-08-27) — RAPTOR is the sweep's first completed technique,
measured, pinned, and written down at `VerifiedBy=benchmark`. Before that, **#176, answered
2026-08-26 and shipped in #405** — see Phase state below; the finding is that the singletons are
honest and the obvious fix would make the graph worse. Before it, **Phase 6.2.9 — `Umap.Fit` at
Corpus Scale** (#348), built 2026-08-25.
Measured before changing anything, which is what makes the rest of it quotable: the kNN graph is
**92% of `Umap.Fit`'s time and 98% of its allocation**, so #348 named the right target. Bounded
k-selection replaced the full sort and the row loop parallelises above 512 rows —
**5.2× faster, ~729× less allocated, Gen0/1/2 all to zero**. Two runs per state on an idle machine;
the table is in `ROADMAP.md`'s 6.2.9 entry.

**It also corrected two claims in its own issue.** #348 argued from the ~1,368 s corpus tree build
that this was "real time rather than a micro-optimisation" — the level-1 reduction is ~82 s of that,
about **6%**, since the tree build is dominated by LLM summarisation. And the sort-to-selection
change everyone would call the headline bought **21%** on its own; the distance loop it does not
touch is the real cost, and parallelising *that* bought the 4×.

**Earlier in Milestone 6.2:** **Phase 6.2.3 — Corpus-Level RAPTOR**, merged 2026-08-21 in #340
(squash `c461475d`). Seven tasks, each independently reviewed, plus a whole-branch review and one
fix wave.

`Rag.NET.Raptor` built its tree **per document**, which is not the RAPTOR paper's mechanism — a
per-document tree cannot contain a node spanning two documents. It now clusters over the corpus by
default (`RaptorTreeScope`, a breaking change), backed by a new `Rag.NET.Raptor.Store` package
holding leaf chunks *with their vectors*, debounced on growth with an on-demand `RaptorTreeRebuilder`
— #302's shape, for #302's reason.

**Two further defects were found by reading the package, and neither had ever been reachable by a
test:** #332, summary chunks colliding on `ChunkIndex` across levels; and #333, `SelectK` returning
k=n so a level never reduced and the tree loop **never terminated**, at one LLM call per cluster per
level — an unbounded spend at shipped defaults, in a published package.

**Why the suite was green throughout is the finding worth keeping.** A mock embedder constructed
`new Random(123)` *inside* its callback, so every summary embedding was byte-identical; identical
points collapse to k=1 and the loop exits after one level. **No test had ever built a RAPTOR tree
deeper than one level**, and both defects need depth ≥ 2. Two more fixtures of the same shape were
found while fixing it. The review loop also caught a first attempt at #333's fix that would have let
**one stray chunk switch clustering off for an entire corpus**, and a #332 regression test that had
become provably vacuous — it passed against the unfixed code.

**Phase state: 6.2.1's four named debts are all closed.** #239 and #200 on 2026-08-17, #247 on
2026-08-18 (pinned at 0.3494 in #280), and **#176 on 2026-08-26 in #405**.

**#176 was answered by reading names, not by moving a number — and the answer is that it is not a
defect worth fixing.** The counts were already understood: 853 of 16,403 relationships (5.20%) are
dropped because an endpoint resolves to no extracted entity, stranding 123 entities that do have
edges, and 273 + 123 is **exactly** the pinned slice's 396 singletons. What nobody had checked is
what those endpoints are *called*. They are **565 distinct names**, and they are not entities the
extractor missed — `content policies` (10), `tasks` (10), `smart plug` (9), `handy tool` (8), `film`
(7), `ceremony` (6), `death` (5) — common nouns, mixed with paraphrases of things that *are*
extracted: `Falun Gong practitioners` beside the entity `Falun Gong`, `Rachel's husband`.

**That rules out the obvious fix.** Promoting an unresolved endpoint into an entity drives the
singleton share down while adding 565 junk nodes named after common nouns — a better-looking number
over a worse graph. **The singleton count is precisely the metric easiest to move without helping
anything**, which is the transferable part. Nothing was changed on the strength of it. Any real fix
belongs in the extraction prompt and must be measured against retrieval. The full-corpus 78.8%
(2,816 of 3,573) stands as a documented property rather than an open debt. Cost: zero model calls —
the extraction cache was replayed refuse-on-miss.

## Open Decisions

- ~~Does #345's average-only cluster bound need a post-assignment split?~~ **Answered 2026-08-23 by
  measurement: no.** The first corpus-scale RAPTOR tree (17,648 chunks, 183 summaries, depth 3,
  1,368 s) puts 549 chunks in its largest level-1 cluster against a mean of 99.7 — **5.51x
  imbalance**, so the floor demonstrably does not bound the maximum. It still fits: ~57k tokens
  against 128k, 2.25x headroom, 44% of the imbalance budget consumed. The split stays unbuilt on
  evidence. **The user-facing consequence is that raising `TargetClusterSize` has ~2.25x of room,
  not the ~12.6x "average 100 against a 128k context" implies** — recorded in
  `docs/guide/raptor.md`'s Cluster Size section.

- ~~Does 6.1's live-service recording gate v1.0?~~ **Decided 2026-08-20: yes, it gates.** Against
  the re-plan's own recommendation, which had argued for `<VerifiedByReason>` on the grounds that a
  criterion satisfiable only by credentials that may never arrive is not falsifiable. 6.1's *work*
  is postponed behind 6.2.3; its *gate* is kept. The trade-off was raised and accepted: **v1.0 now
  waits on 18 cassettes whose blocker is accounts rather than effort.** Nothing in the codebase can
  move this — if the accounts do not arrive, the tag does not either. Worth revisiting if 6.2.3
  lands and 6.1 is still the only thing outstanding.
- **Where local search's yes/no abstention comes from.** It commits on 8.8% of comparison and 4.3%
  of temporal questions, while global search scores 0.4953 and 0.3928 on the same ones. A
  characterisation nobody has explained; it needs a home in 6.2.1 or an explicit deferral.
- **#298 — graph store backends beyond SQLite.** Recorded answer: *not yet*, and weaker now than
  when asked. Both costs once attributed to storage were a missing index and a per-document
  recompute, fixed without changing engines. Concurrency is the only surviving argument and nobody
  has stated that requirement.

## Blockers

- **6.1 is blocked on accounts, not on work — and as of 2026-08-20 it gates v1.0.** The harness
  works as of #290; 1 of 19 cassettes is recorded (GitHub, unauthenticated, 17 KB). #283 carries
  the corrected instructions for the remaining 18 and is marked help-wanted. No amount of local
  effort moves this, so it is the milestone's only blocker that engineering cannot clear.
- ~~**The #300 follow-up measurement needs an idle machine.**~~ **Done 2026-08-18; this entry was
  stale for a week.** The split is recorded in `BeirRunBudget`'s `GraphRag` cell: measured over the
  real corpus at 50/100/200/400/609 documents, **twice**, with the 609-document graph reproducing
  exactly (62,392 entities, 147,021 relationships). **The recompute was not where the time went** —
  Leiden + PageRank + the score write-back is **2.7 s**, at 0.044 ms per entity, a coefficient stable
  within 6% across both runs and all five sizes. What #302's debounce removed, projected from that
  coefficient, is **13.6 minutes** summed over 609 documents. Extraction and report generation are
  I/O-bound cache replays and no figure is quoted for them, because 152.9 s cold against 18.7 s warm
  is a page-cache artefact of reading 35,176 files rather than a property of extraction.

## Recommended Next Step

**~~6.2.31 (#513)~~, ~~6.2.32 (#521)~~ and ~~6.2.33 (#530)~~ all MERGED 2026-09-09** — in #522,
#527 and #531. **~~#495~~ closed the same day as not reproducible** after investigation; what it
actually produced is **#529**, the one project where `dotnet test --filter` is silently ignored.

**The queue is now: 6.2.34 (#328, account-blocked), #529, #184, the security-position document, and
PR #314.** 6.2.34 is written up and ready but cannot be verified without an Azure resource; #529 is
small and fully local; #184 is breaking and wants a design pass. Previously ordered — #495 is an investigation rather than defined work,
#328 is blocked on a score-scale decision that is the operator's, #184 is breaking and wants a
design pass before code, and #314 is a major dependency bump that deserves its own phase rather
than a line inside someone else's.

**Previously, when #521 was the head of the queue:** it joined the list from 6.2.31: PgVector, Qdrant and Azure AI Search return an empty dictionary on a corrupt metadata blob
while Weaviate throws — the three are a pre-review default, the one is a reviewed decision, and
Redis now follows the reviewed one. Small, and it removes a silent path from three stores at once.

**Previously (the choice, kept for the reasoning): #513** chosen by the operator on
2026-09-09 over #184, #495 and #328. It is 6.2.26's own finding: the Redis keyed lookup was built
and works, but the store writes only `document_id`, `chunk_index`, `text` and `embedding`, so
**neither search nor lookup can return metadata on this backend and both succeed while returning
none.** 6.2.26 asserted the limitation rather than skipping past it, so the test fails the day
`StoreAsync` starts storing it — which is the day this phase arrives. Same storage surface as the
seven phases before it, and real Redis runs locally.

**What else is open, after it:**

1. **#495** — the deep-research cell replays its cache in a fresh worktree and misses in the primary
   checkout, on identical content. Unexplained, and it undermines confidence in every cached
   benchmark figure until it is.
2. **#328** — Azure AI Search's semantic ranker, split out of 6.2.5 pending a score-scale decision
   nobody has taken. 6.2.30 has just reopened that file.
3. **#184** — breaking, and pre-1.0 is the moment for it. Larger: a design decision before any code.
4. **The security-position document** (below, still true).
5. **#299, #298, #175, #153** — all carry recorded answers or deferrals rather than open work.
6. **PR #314** — the xunit-dotnet v4 major bump, still open as a renovate PR, still deserving to be
   its own piece of work rather than a line inside someone else's.

---

**Superseded 2026-09-09, kept for the reasoning. Items 1 and 2 below are both closed** — #337's
residue in 6.2.19 and #475 in 6.2.18 — and the list did not say so for two days.

**6.2.1 closed on 2026-09-06 and five phases have shipped since. The text below is kept for its
reasoning, not as a next step.** What is actually open, in the order worth taking it:

1. ~~**#337's residue.**~~ **Closed 2026-09-07 in 6.2.19.** The floor is fixed and mutation-checked;
   what remains is the near-duplicate characterisation the issue also describes. Smallest
   well-understood item.
2. ~~**#475**~~ — **closed 2026-09-07 in 6.2.18 (#494).** Filed while fixing #338, not yet scoped.
3. **The security-position document.** **Scoped as Phase 6.2.38 on 2026-09-10** — this entry sat
   here unscheduled from 2026-09-07 until then, which is the record-then-schedule rule failing
   quietly: it was recorded, and then nobody put it in a phase. #198 shipped the authenticated MCP
   transport, but nothing states the project's posture in prose. **Related, and it corrects an alarm rather than raising
   one:** the five Dependabot alerts on `main` were triaged 2026-09-07 and **none reach the shipped
   NuGet packages.** `image-size` and `nltk` (both high) have **no patch** and live in the Docusaurus
   build and the Python comparison harness; `qs` (medium, patched at 6.16.0) enters via
   `webpack-dev-server` and reaches only `npm start`. A one-line `overrides` entry fixes the only
   fixable one. **This does not gate v1.0** — a .NET consumer's dependency closure contains none of
   it.
4. **#184** — breaking, and pre-1.0 is the moment for it.
5. **#314** — the xunit-dotnet v4 major bump, which deserves to be its own piece of work rather than
   a line inside someone else's.

**6.1 remains the only thing between the project and the v1.0 tag**, blocked on accounts rather than
effort. Nothing above changes that.

**Twenty-five local branches besides `main` are left behind** as of 2026-09-09 — twenty-one on
2026-09-07, and the keyed-lookup run added the rest. They are noise in every subsequent
`git branch`; deleting them is safe once each is verified on `main` by content — not by a MERGED
label, for the reason this file repeats elsewhere. **`feat/318-azureaisearch-chunklookup` is the
clearest case**: its single commit `e868f898` was squash-merged as `526380cf` (#518), so it is
one commit "ahead" of `main` while containing nothing `main` lacks. The count is not being reduced
because nobody has asked for a sweep, not because any of them are in doubt.

---

**Superseded 2026-09-07, kept for the reasoning. 6.2.1 has nothing left of its own.** All three clauses of its exit condition are met: the
pipeline-parity test is in the fast tier, no allowlist entry is owned by this phase, and every row
6.0 classified as *plan* here carries its pointer and its pin. **The next decision is whether to
close the phase** — `complete-phase` — and then what Milestone 6 does about 6.1, which is the only
thing between the project and the v1.0 tag and is blocked on accounts rather than effort.

**Before closing it, re-run the reconciliation the SPLADE discharge taught.** The guard cannot see
an entry whose work is DONE but unpointed: it checks that an entry has no pointer and that a pointer
names a real class, and an unpointed-but-finished entry satisfies both. Count
`SectionsAwaitingExercise` against `features.md` by hand once more before declaring the clause met.

**What the five discharged cells cost in total: about $5.60 priced, far less actually spent** —
metadata $4.63 (already paid before this session), deep research ~$0.65 of a $0.89 ceiling, mind-map
$0.03, conversation memory ~$0.04, self-query $0.01.

**Superseded, kept for the reasoning:** the three entries below were the remaining work and are now
done. **Pilot each before funding it** still holds as a rule — #470's pilot found the silent `{}`
shortfall a well-formedness check would have called 120/120 success.

**BEFORE SPENDING ANYTHING, COUNT THE CACHE.** `~/.cache/ragnet-beir/<subdirectory>` is a spend
ledger and nothing in this repository reads it. On 2026-09-05 a session asked the operator to fund a
$4.63 run that an earlier session the same day had already paid for and left unrecorded; the tell was
a never-run cell reporting 20,155 hits and 0 misses. **Read a perfect hit rate on a first run as an
alarm, not a result** — it is either prior work or a colliding key, and counting entries against
expected units separates them in one command.

---

**2026-09-05, later — LLM Metadata Extraction measured and discharged, `SectionsAwaitingExercise`
38 → 37.**

| arm | n | coverage | correct | cross-domain |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SciFact (whole) | 20,155 | **98.79%** | 99.88% | finance × 23 |
| FiQA (capped control) | 1,000 | **62.70%** | 96.33% | biomedical × 23 |

**The corpus is the only variable, so the 36.09-point gap is the corpus.** Same behaviour, model,
schema, temperature and cache on both arms. The pilot predicted ~40 points from 120 chunks and got
36.09 — its finding held, and a single-corpus run could not have established it. FiQA is capped
because its 121,236 units are ~$28 and ~44 hours; **the cap is arithmetic, not thrift.**

**The shortfall is live on the shipped path.** Misses are a literal `{}`, nothing throws, and the
behaviour attaches with `TryAdd` plus a per-chunk warning — so **37.30% of a FiQA-shaped corpus is
unlabelled with nothing louder than a log**, and a filter over that key silently does not match.
Both figures are pinned at ±0.5 and mutation-checked at 0.6; replay being deterministic, the pin
guards the attachment path rather than the model.

**Also fixed on the way:** a line in `docs/reference/ci.md` was triplicated on itself — introduced
doubled by #468 and worsened by #470, and on `main` for two days. Nothing guards prose for that.

---

**2026-09-05 — the technique sweep is COMPLETE. Five techniques, three corpora each, fifteen cells,
every figure pinned and reproduced.**

| corpus | HyDE | Reranking | Hybrid BM25 | Late chunking | SPLADE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SciFact | +0.03647 | +0.01266 | +0.01880 | −0.02232 | +0.01276 |
| FiQA | −0.00886 | −0.00951 | −0.04185 | **+0.02800** | −0.05527 |
| ArguAna | −0.02053 | −0.06938 | **+0.03978** | +0.01429 | +0.01258 |

**Corpus dominates technique.** SciFact is helped by four of five; FiQA harmed by four of five and
helped only by late chunking; ArguAna splits on the kind of matching. **No row is a recommendation
without naming the corpus** — the phase's finding, not a caveat on it.

**The ArguAna prediction, written before SPLADE ran, is confirmed at +0.01258.** Both term-matching
techniques help that corpus; both dense-path techniques harm it. The surviving explanation — that
the harm is specific to matching a document-shaped or semantically-rescored query against fragments
— survived a test that could have refuted it.

**SPLADE was blocked on provisioning, not capability.** `Qdrant/Splade_PP_en_v1`, 508 MB, pinned with
its digest in `docs/reference/ci.md`; the canonical NAVER model publishes no ONNX export at all. The
shipped encoder had never run against a real model in this repository before 2026-09-04.

**Measured on an idle machine, deliberately.** All three cells in 2 h 59 m; a first attempt took ~80
minutes for SciFact alone under load. **The per-dataset `elapsed` lines understate these cells** —
encoding happens before the harness's stopwatch starts.

**2026-09-03, fifth change — late chunking measured on three corpora, and it found a shipped defect
on the way.**

| corpus | HyDE | Reranking | Hybrid BM25 | Late chunking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SciFact | +0.03647 | +0.01266 | +0.01880 | **−0.02232** |
| FiQA | −0.00886 | −0.00951 | −0.04185 | **+0.02800** |
| ArguAna | −0.02053 | −0.06938 | +0.03978 | **+0.01429** |

**Late chunking is anti-correlated with the other three** — the only one negative on SciFact and
positive on both others. **The first retrieval-quality figure it has ever had**: the allowlist entry
claimed Phase 3.7 measured it, and 3.7 measured the parity dense anchor instead.

**THE SHIPPED DEFECT, and it is the session's most consequential find.**
`OnnxTokenEmbeddingOptions.MaxTokens` defaulted to **8192** where its sibling in the same package
defaults to **256**, for the same model. Windowing therefore never triggered, ONNX threw at the
position-embedding node, `LateChunkingStrategy` swallowed it, and `EmbeddingBehavior` backfilled
ordinary embeddings — so **`UseLateChunking()` silently did nothing on every document long enough to
need it**, with no error and no log. 1,401 of 9,506 SciFact units before the fix. Fixed to 256, and
guarded by a test pinning the **relationship** between the two encoders' limits rather than the
number.

**It was found only because the benchmark seam refuses to fall back.** Nothing else in the repo
would have surfaced it.

**Two claims of mine retired by this thread**, both written as statements about corpora when the
evidence only supported statements about the techniques measured so far: ArguAna's fragmentation
explanation (refuted by hybrid), and "FiQA is the corpus nothing helps" (refuted by late chunking).

**One framing error corrected.** Three places said the cell "keeps the Real protocol's boundaries and
changes only how their vectors are computed". It varies **both** — late chunking windows at its own
256 tokens, producing 9,507 / 73,014 / 11,137 units against the Real cells' 20,155 / 121,236 /
24,003. The unit counts were available before the run. **So no figure here isolates whole-document
context**; separating it needs a control with late chunking's boundaries and ordinary embeddings,
which no cell runs.

**And a guard of mine was weakened after it fired, deliberately and with arithmetic.** The original
asserted no excluded document is judged-relevant; SciFact's 15319019 falsified it. It was replaced by
a bounded check — worst case `affectedQueries / judgedQueries` = **0.00333 against a ±0.005 band** —
which refuses outright above the band. Weakening "none" to "bounded" is defensible; weakening it to
"reported" would not have been.

**Costs 430.9 s / 2,295.7 s / 494.0 s, with NO warm speedup** — the only cell in the table where a
re-run is not cheaper, because `EmbeddingCache` is keyed on text and a late-chunked vector is not a
function of chunk text alone. Its budget entry declined to derive a cost beforehand, and it is the
only cost entry in the phase that needed no correction after.

**2026-09-03, fourth change — hybrid BM25 measured on three corpora, and it refuted an explanation
this phase had asserted twice.**

| corpus | HyDE | Reranking | Hybrid BM25 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SciFact | +0.03647 | +0.01266 | +0.01880 |
| FiQA | −0.00886 | −0.00951 | **−0.04185** |
| ArguAna | −0.02053 | −0.06938 | **+0.03978** |

**Corpus dominates technique.** SciFact was helped by everything measured at the time; ~~**FiQA is
harmed by everything measured**~~ — **RETIRED 2026-09-03 by late chunking at +0.02800**, the largest
positive effect any technique has had on FiQA; ArguAna splits on the *kind* of matching.
has no answer here without knowing the corpus — that is the phase's finding, not a caveat on it.

**The refutation, and it was set up in writing before the run.** ArguAna's harm under HyDE and
reranking had been attributed to its whole-argument relevance making 512-character fragments the
wrong unit. This cell's own pre-run text said: *"BM25 is the test of that explanation: if fragments
are the problem, a term-frequency model over the same fragments should suffer too."* **It does not
suffer — +0.03978, the best Real-protocol figure ArguAna has**, above its Real dense control and
above its parity dense. Fragmentation alone is not the cause. What survives is narrower and untested:
the harm is specific to matching a document-shaped or semantically-rescored query against fragments.
Both places the old claim was asserted are now struck and annotated in `ROADMAP.md`.

**Sign held on all three hybrid pairs.** Across nine (technique, corpus) pairs measured under both
protocols, **exactly one flips** — FiQA reranking. Parity predicts the sign eight times in nine and
the magnitude never.

**Costs: 172.5 s / 308.6 s / 1,164.4 s, no model calls.** The cheapest technique, as predicted.
FiQA came in *below* its own ~58 m parity sibling, opposite to its derivation: BM25 indexing is
term-count work, and many short chunks hold roughly the same terms as fewer long documents while each
posting list is shorter. **Fourth cost derivation in this phase to miss.** ArguAna's held, and the
difference is that it reasoned from a mechanism — query count drives these cells — rather than
scaling a number from another corpus.

**Two guards earned their keep on this branch.** Wiring the cells without `Describe` and `Filter`
arms failed four fast-tier tests immediately — including `NoCellsDiscriminatorIsContainedInAnothers`
and `TheSkipMessagesCommand_OptsInOnlyTheCasesOwnDataset`, both added in #439 — catching before push
exactly the gap that left #433 red on CI for a day. The parity discriminator needed the same trailing
underscore treatment as Hyde and Reranked did.

**2026-09-03, third change — the `Delivered` blind spot closed the day after it was found.** All
nine sections normalised to `✅ Done`; six took one-line pointers naming tests that already existed,
three took allowlist entries with owning phases because nothing exercises them. **Section allowlist
40 → 43 — worse and truer at once**, since those three were previously counted at zero by a guard
that could not see them. Mutation-checked: removing the Weaviate pointer now fails the guard naming
that section, which was impossible yesterday.

**The status question resolved by evidence, not preference.** `Delivered` was never a status: the
three vector stores sit between two `✅ Done` sections in the same region, and every `Delivered` line
follows one authoring pattern where the status line carries the whole description. Nothing defined
it anywhere.

**And the cost estimate that preceded it was wrong in the useful direction.** The debt entry said
folding these in meant "nine pointer-writing tasks, which is work rather than a one-line fix". Six
were one-line fixes. The estimate was made without checking what already existed — the same
incomplete-look shape as the Late Chunking slip in that entry's first draft, on the same day, in the
same entry. **Check before costing, not after.**

**2026-09-03, second discharge — `Rag.NET.QueryTechniques`, allowlist 19 → 18. 6.2.1 now owns none
of the remaining entries.** `HydePipelineParityTests` holds the shipped `HydeBehavior` to the
harness's `HydeAblationRow`: same three hypotheses, same store, a real `AddRagNet` pipeline with
`UseHyde` on one side and the row's own pooling on the other, identical ids, scores and order. Fast
tier — no model, no corpus, no network. **Mutation-checked**: skewing one component of the shipped
pooled vector by 5% fails it at rank 0 on a 0.0002 score difference.

**This is what the yesterday's warning was about, now closed.** The three HyDE figures executed no
line of the package; the two pooling implementations were arithmetically identical line for line, in
two assemblies, with nothing tying them together. The test ties them, so the figures describe shipped
behaviour rather than a re-implementation.

**Level `integration`, deliberately not `benchmark`.** Enough to say the figures describe the shipped
path; not enough to say a benchmark ran through it, because the parity corpus is six documents in two
dimensions rather than a BEIR corpus in 384. **Claiming `benchmark` would be the same overclaim this
phase has twice retracted.** Running a Real cell through the shipped generator would earn it and was
considered; it was not taken.

**One geometry error worth carrying**, because it cost a cycle and the fix is general: the first
fixture put the three hypotheses on documents 3, 4 and 5, expecting their mean to rank the corpus in
reverse. **The mean of three unit vectors points at the middle one**, so the resultant landed exactly
on document 4 and documents 3 and 5 tied — a ranking decided by sort stability rather than geometry.
The angles are asymmetric now (3.8, 4.3, 5.1 steps, resultant 4.399) and the expected order was
computed from the geometry rather than read off a run. **A pinned expectation derived from the code
under test pins nothing.**

**2026-09-03 — the exit condition's allowlist moved for the first time this milestone.**
`PackagesAllowedToStayUnit` **20 → 19**, `SectionsAwaitingExercise` **42 → 40**, by discharging
`Rag.NET.AnswerEngines`: all three engines carry a pinned figure against a control, so the package
went `unit` → **`benchmark`**, and Map-Reduce and Refine gained `Exercised by:` pointers naming the
arm, the reproduction and the number. Both halves are guard-enforced and were **mutation-checked**,
not assumed: reverting the level fails `NoPackageStaysAtBareUnit`, removing a pointer fails the
exercise guard. 94/94 conventions tests green.

**`Rag.NET.QueryTechniques` was NOT discharged, and this is the trap to avoid next session.** Three
corpora of HyDE figures make it look done. `HydeAblationRow` imports `HydeOptions` and nothing else
from the package — the hypotheticals come from `HypotheticalCache`, written by a separate generation
tool, and the shipped `LlmHypotheticalDocumentGenerator` is exercised only by unit tests. **The
measurements characterise the technique and touch none of the shipped code.** Closing it needs a
test proving the harness row and the shipped generator agree — the same harness-versus-shipped-path
gap the pipeline-parity test closed for retrieval — not another measurement.

**And a guard blind spot was found while doing it**, recorded in `ROADMAP.md`'s follow-up debts and
assigned to this phase: `FeatureExerciseTests` matches the literal `**Status:** ✅ Done`, so the
**nine `**Status:** Delivered` sections are invisible to it** — including HyDE v2, FLARE, SPLADE and
the Weaviate/Chroma/Pinecone stores, six of which are 6.2.1's own threads. The phase cannot claim
"every plan row has its pointer" while nine rows are outside the guard. Deliberately not fixed on
discovery: whether `Delivered` is a distinct status or drift is undetermined, and widening the marker
turns nine sections into nine pointer-writing tasks. **Decide the status question first.**

**HyDE is finished on every corpus where it can be measured.** TREC-COVID is not unscheduled but
**unmeasurable at any budget**: nobody has generated its hypotheticals, so the cell fails on
refuse-on-miss after paying for the chunking. A fourth corpus for HyDE means a **paid generation
run** that has never been costed — a separate piece of work, not a scheduling decision.

**Do not run any cell with `=1`.** It still means every dataset, and TREC-COVID's Real leg has never
been embedded — a `RealHyde` or `RealReranked` run that reaches it chunks and embeds a corpus 33x
SciFact's from cold and then fails on refuse-on-miss, because nobody has generated its hypotheticals.
That is the trap that cost 6 h 18 m on 2026-09-01.

**Three things this session established that the next one should not re-derive:**

1. **A parity-corpus ablation figure overstates what a technique buys a real user.** HyDE +0.055 at
   parity against +0.036 real; reranking +0.039 against +0.013, and negative on FiQA. Two techniques,
   same direction. Every remaining cell in this table is worth measuring under Real for that reason,
   and the parity number is not a substitute.
2. **A green local run over a gated-off suite is not evidence about the gated-off path.** #433 was
   red on CI for a day because `Explain` is only reached when a case is gated *off*, and every local
   run had the opt-in set. Run the fast tier once with no `RAGNET_*` variables before pushing.
3. **Confirm a pin with a second run before trusting its cost.** The two SciFact `RealHyde` runs
   agreed on nDCG to five decimals and disagreed on wall clock by 16x, 199.5 s against 12.5 s. The
   figure survived; the timing would have been published warm.

**Still open in 6.2.1, in rough order of cost:** FiQA/ArguAna/TREC-COVID `RealHyde` and the two unrun
`RealReranked` cells; hybrid BM25, late chunking and SPLADE under the Real protocol; every vector
store through the SciFact parity leg; local search's yes/no abstention, still unexplained; and
`refine`'s −0.1055, whose caveat MapReduce turned into a live question rather than a hedge. The exit
condition also wants every 6.0 *plan* row pinned and the guards' allowlist empty.

**The self-query pilot ran against a real model on 2026-09-05, and it cost about a hundredth of a
cent.** Six queries, six calls; 5 produced a filter and all 5 named the query's own corpus. Both
mechanism gates held, and a replay run afterwards returned 6 cache hits and 0 misses, so the
pay-once-replay-free pattern is proven for this feature rather than assumed. It publishes NO
accuracy figure — six queries cannot support one, and RAPTOR's pilot headline reversed at full
scale.

**Two corrections it forced, both of mine.**

1. **#467 claimed the funded self-query run "would have crashed on ordinary replies"** because an
   object-shaped `filters` is "what a schema-free prompt most often gets back". The crash is real
   and the fix is right, but that frequency claim was speculation and the first evidence
   contradicts it: **all six real replies used the correct array shape.** The one that produced no
   filter returned an empty array, not a malformed one. Nothing so far validates the fix, because
   no reply took the crashing path. Asserting a frequency without evidence is the same habit that
   mispriced two runs in this phase.
2. **The pilot's own cache-empty gate reported a full cache as empty.** `GraphExtractionCache`
   SHARDS entries into subdirectories by key prefix, and the first draft enumerated the top level
   only — the exact hazard that file's own documentation warns about. Six entries on disk, and the
   replay run skipped saying "nothing to replay". Fixed to enumerate recursively.

**And a finding about the shipped behaviour, which reframes what this entry can claim.**
`SelfQueryBehavior` writes its filter into `RetrievalOptions.Filter`, an
`ISpecification<SearchResult>` that `FilterBehavior` applies as `results.Where(...)` AFTER
retrieval — with no over-fetch and no backfill. It never writes `MetadataFilter`, the field
`InMemoryVectorStore` pre-filters on. **So self-query narrows a page of results; it does not scope
the search.** On a two-corpus store a query asking for ten gets ten, discards the foreign ones and
returns fewer. The tag-filtered cell's 0.67742 came from a pre-filter and is therefore not a target
this path can reach, which is worth knowing before the full run is designed around it.

**Self-Query is measured and discharged (2026-09-05), and its figure is not what I predicted.**
300 judged queries, 300 model calls, ~$0.01; a replay run returned 300 cache hits, 0 misses and an
identical figure, so the pin is confirmed. **nDCG@10 0.68247** — against **0.67742** for the same
two-corpus store filtered by hand and **0.67065** unfiltered.

**I predicted it could not reach 0.67742 and it beat it.** The reasoning was that `FilterBehavior`
applies self-query's filter as `results.Where(...)` after retrieval with no backfill, so the page
can only shrink. That part is true — 4,496 hits were discarded across 300 queries. The error was
treating the filter as the whole technique. `SelfQueryBehavior` also REWRITES the query, and the
pipeline embeds the rewrite; a filter can only remove, so with the same query vector the
post-filtered page is a prefix of the pre-filtered ranking and cannot score higher. **The rewrite is
the only mechanism that can explain +0.00505, and the cell measures rewrite and filter together.**

That is also why the row drives `AddRagNet` rather than a hand-composed chain. The first draft
composed generate → search → `Where` by hand and could not apply the rewrite at all, because
`EmbeddingTextOverride` is `internal` to Rag.NET. It would have measured the filter alone, produced
a LOWER number, and carried the technique's name — the same class of error as the HyDE and RRF
harness gaps this phase has been closing.

**The post-filter's structural cost is real and this harness cannot see it.** `BeirHarness:736` sets
`TopK = (Cutoff + …) × maxUnitsPerDocument`, which is 410 deep for a cutoff of 10, so ~15 discards
per query never approach the cutoff. A caller retrieving at `TopK` 10 would see the shrinkage. The
pointer says so rather than letting the figure read as a clean endorsement.

**6.1 remains the milestone's only blocker engineering cannot clear****6.1 remains the milestone's only blocker engineering cannot clear** — 18 cassettes, blocked on
accounts rather than effort, and gating v1.0 by the operator's 2026-08-20 decision.

---

**2026-09-05, second change — three more allowlist entries discharged, `SectionsAwaitingExercise`
41 → 38, and only ONE of the three needed new code.** The pattern from the 2026-09-04 audit held:
entries drift from what the repository already contains.

**BM25 Synonym Expansion needed nothing built.** `InMemoryBm25IndexSynonymTests` already drives the
real index with and without a `SynonymMap` — "Kubernetes" indexed and retrieved by "k8s", a
three-term group matching on all forms, a runtime addition taking effect, and
`Search_NoSynonymMap_ExistingBehaviourUnchanged` pinning the without-expansion case returning
nothing. That **is** the with-and-without pair the entry asked for, at the mechanism level.

**Hierarchical Merger and Domain-Specific Templates needed one new test between them.**
`RealPaperExerciseTests` runs a real markdown paper through the real `MarkdownDocumentParser` into
both strategies. **The parser is not re-implemented**, which is the whole point: both strategies had
unit tests and sat on the allowlist anyway, because those tests hand-build their `DocumentSection`
inputs and so cannot catch a disagreement between strategy and parser about what a heading is.
Mutation-checked — stripping the `##` markers fails both.

**All three pointers state what they do NOT claim.** None carries a retrieval-quality figure. The
entries wanted Real-protocol cells; **no BEIR corpus has headings** (SciFact documents are a title
and an abstract, checked against the corpus rather than assumed) and `SynonymMap` ships empty, so a
synonym cell would have measured whichever vocabulary its author invented. Both entries offered a
second route and both took it. **Whether heading-aware chunking or synonym expansion helps retrieval
is unmeasured and says so in the pointer**, because a mechanism test and a quality figure are not
interchangeable.

**Eight entries remain**, and the shape is now: five needing a paid model under one funding
decision, one compute-only cell (Tag-Based Retrieval Filtering — a filtered parity leg, needing a
decision about what tags), and two operator decisions (Time-Weighted's "declared" route, and
Ensemble/RRF's swap to the library's `RrfMerger`).

**A correction to the 2026-09-04 audit, which called four of these "cheap runs".** Two were not runs
at all: Hierarchical Merger's Real-protocol framing is unsatisfiable on any corpus here, and
Domain-Specific Templates keys on the same absent headings. The audit costed them by reading the
entries rather than checking them against the corpus — better than guessing and still one layer
short.

**What is left in this phase, and it is no longer measurement of techniques.** The exit condition
has three clauses: the pipeline-parity test (met), the package allowlist (no 6.2.1 entries remain),
and every row 6.0 classified as *plan* carrying its pointer and its pin. Only the third is open, and
it is **five `SectionsAwaitingExercise` entries** — thirteen at the 2026-09-04 audit, which found
two stale rather than owed, less the three #462 discharged, Ensemble/RRF, SPLADE, Time-Weighted and
Tag-Based. **All five that remain need a paid model, so the phase's remaining work is one decision
rather than a queue.**

**Time-Weighted took the sanctioned `declared` route on the operator's 2026-09-05 call**, and
checking it went one layer deeper than the entry did. "BEIR carries no timestamps" is true, but
"BEIR carries no metadata" would have been false: SciFact, FiQA and ArguAna ship `metadata: {}`
while TREC-COVID ships `url` and `pubmed_id`. Neither is a date, so the declaration holds — but
resolving those PubMed ids to publication dates would make a pinned figure depend on a third-party
service, which is the reason to decline rather than an oversight, and the pointer says so.

**SPLADE was discharged by writing one line, and finding it was the useful part.** The dictionary
held eight entries while the prose said seven, and the eighth was not an arithmetic slip: #461
measured SPLADE retrieval on three corpora and pinned it — exactly what the entry asked for — but no
pointer was ever added to `features.md`, so the entry stayed and the guard stayed green on it. **The
guard cannot see that shape.** It checks that an entry has no pointer and that a pointer names a
real class; an entry whose work is DONE but unpointed satisfies both and is indistinguishable from
one that is genuinely owed. Only reconciling the count against the dictionary surfaced it. Worth
re-running that reconciliation after any phase that discharges several entries at once.

**They are not seven equal units, which is the point of the audit:**

- **Five need a paid model** — Self-Query, LLM Metadata Extraction, Deep Research Loop, Mind-Map
  Extractor, Conversational Memory. All drive an `IChatClient`. `CachedGraphRagClient` plus the
  on-disk `graph-extractions`, `graph-reports` and `graph-answers` caches are how the GraphRAG work
  paid once and replayed free; the same shape applies. **One funding decision covers all five.**
- **The compute-only group is empty.** It was four. #462 discharged three, two of which turned out
  not to be runs at all, and Tag-Based Retrieval Filtering was measured on 2026-09-05.
- **Time-Weighted is closed** — declared on 2026-09-05, the route the entry itself sanctioned. It
  drops the count without measuring anything, which is what declaring means and what the pointer
  admits: whether recency weighting helps retrieval on a real dated corpus stays unverified.

**Ensemble/RRF is discharged (2026-09-05), and it found something.** `HybridFusionParityTests`
retrieves through a real `IRagPipeline` with `UseHybridSearch` set, so `EnsembleBehavior` fuses a
dense and a lexical arm through the library's own `RrfMerger`, and holds that to the `+BM25` cell's
hand-composed fusion. The two agreed on k and on the 1-based rank formula, and **disagreed on the
weights**: the row weighted each leg 1.0 while `EnsembleOptions` defaults `DenseWeight` and
`Bm25Weight` to 0.5 each, so every harness score was exactly twice the library's. That is a uniform
factor on an RRF sum — it reorders nothing, nDCG cannot see it, and the SciFact cell reproduced its
pinned 0.69622 after the row was brought onto the library's default. It mattered anyway: it is
visible to anything reading the fused score, `MinScore` first, and removing it let the test assert
score equality outright instead of equality-up-to-a-factor.

**The order-only version of that test was worthless and the mutation check is what said so.**
Changing the row's rank constant from 60 to 10 left it green — RRF rankings barely move with k. Only
after the score assertion went in did both that mutation and a 0-based-rank mutation fail. This is
the fourth guard on this branch that looked right and proved nothing until it was mutated; the
pattern is now consistent enough to treat mutation as part of writing the guard, not a review step.

**Tag-Based is measured, and the design choice WAS the job.** BEIR chunks carry no tags, so
filtering on an invented vocabulary would have measured the invention — the trap that emptied three
of the other four cheap entries. The operator chose the corpus a document came from, which is a fact
about the data rather than a choice, and it turned the cell from a score into a TARGET: SciFact
filtered out of a SciFact+FiQA store must reproduce SciFact's standalone figure. **It did, exactly**
— 0.67742 to five decimals, 0 leaked hits over 123,000, against a prediction pinned before the run.
The unfiltered control on the same store scores 0.67065, so the filter was doing work rather than
sitting over a corpus that never competed.

**Two things that run surfaced, neither of them about tagging.** The 26x gap between its two runs
(702.7 s then 26.9 s, identical figures, 0 embedding-cache misses both times) is the OS page cache
over a 141k-unit read — the same artefact that produced three false findings earlier this phase, and
why the cost entry says to budget the cold number. And `SummariseUnits` prints a document count
larger than the dataset's and a NEGATIVE "contributed nothing" figure here, because it assumes
indexed units come from the dataset under measurement. Harmless — the metrics come from qrels — but
a reader meeting "-57587" should know it is a one-corpus assumption meeting a two-corpus store.

**6.1 remains the milestone's only blocker engineering cannot clear** — 18 cassettes, blocked on
accounts, gating v1.0 by the operator's 2026-08-20 decision.

**Three standing cautions, each earned rather than inherited:**

1. **Never run a cell with `RAGNET_BEIR_LONG_RUNS=1`.** It means every dataset. Use a name or a
   comma-separated list; the gate has taken lists since #439.
2. **Confirm every pin with a second run.** Ten cells have been confirmed across this phase and all
   ten reproduced their nDCG to five decimals while **none** reproduced its timing.
3. **Do not derive a cell's cost from another cell.** Five derivations here have missed — high, low,
   by corpus size, by per-query rate, by cost shape. Both entries that declined to derive needed no
   correction.

**And a fourth, earned four times this week:** a benchmark timing taken on a loaded machine is not a
figure this table should carry. SPLADE's SciFact cell read ~80 minutes under load and all three
cells fit in 2 h 59 m idle. The nDCG never moved.


**The text below predates 2026-09-02 and is kept for its reasoning, not its recommendation.** Its
"next step is `MapReduceAnswerEngine`" was carried out: the defect was fixed in #430, the arms were
made comparable in #429, and `mapreduce` was pinned at 0.6483 in #431. Read it for how the three
options were framed, not for what to do next.


**The answer-engine thread has delivered what it can without product work. The next step is
`MapReduceAnswerEngine`, as a shipped-package defect rather than a benchmark chore.**

A caller who sets `RagOptions.SystemPrompt` has it applied to **every per-chunk map**. Instructions
written about the answer — "say so if you don't know", "answer in one word", "end with X" — are false
of a single chunk, and the engine degrades badly: measured at **0.0142** with an abstention rule and
**0.2009** with grounding alone, with the worst extraction-contract compliance of any arm. **This is
the same defect class as the FLARE one fixed in #419**, which was scoped as a shipped-package defect
reachable by any user with a terminal `SystemPrompt`. MapReduce has the identical vulnerability,
unprotected, and a plain user prompt triggers it.

Fixing it protects real users, makes MapReduce measurable, and closes the DoD clause the sweep could
not. `refine` likely needs the same treatment, and its −0.1055 carries a caveat until it gets it.
**Cost: ~$2.50 to re-measure, because only the changed arm re-keys** — 7 calls/query over 2,556
queries. The $20 sweeps are behind, not ahead.

**Validate on a 400-query subset before any full run.** That pattern has now paid for itself twice:
~$3 caught three problems the first time, and predicted every sign of the ~$20 sweep the second.

**That fix is built and merged into the branch, with its guard** — `EngineArmsAnswerUnderTheSameContractAsDense`,
mutation-checked: restoring the previous value compiles at 0 warnings and fails on a string-start
mismatch, in 0.5 s rather than a 6.5-hour paid run. **But the 400-query subset showed the fix is not
sufficient**, so the decision that matters now is which of three ways to make the arms comparable:

1. **Apply grounding and abstention only at each engine's final synthesis step**, leaving fragment
   calls under fragment-appropriate instructions. Correct, and the engines do not expose that seam —
   real work in `Rag.NET.AnswerEngines`, on product surface rather than in the harness.
2. **Drop abstention from the shared contract** (keep grounding and extraction) and score abstention
   separately as its own metric. Smallest change that makes the comparison mean something; slightly
   redefines what the DoD clause measures.
3. **Compare engines only against `chatengine`**, accepting that engine-vs-`dense` mixes in prompt
   effects. Cheapest, and leaves `mapreduce`'s per-chunk problem untouched.

**Validate any of them on a 400-query subset before funding the full sweep.** That pattern has now
paid for itself once: ~$3 found three problems that ~$20 would have found no faster.

**Budget the re-run at 6.5 hours, not 3–4.** The protocol's estimate came from extrapolating the
nine-query pilot's rate and was wrong by ~2×. That is the second time here a pilot rate has failed
to survive extrapolation, after RAPTOR's factor of eight; the pattern is now well enough evidenced
to plan against.

Until then, **HyDE and reranking's re-measurement under the
Real protocol remains the cheapest thread open in the phase that needs no money and no
provisioning** (see below) — it can proceed in parallel with waiting for the pilot machine, not
instead of the pilot.

**~~RAPTOR Task 6~~ — DONE 2026-08-27. RAPTOR is the sweep's first completed technique.** The
ledger the Task 5 measurement earned is now written: `docs/guide/raptor.md` has a `## Measured`
section, `Rag.NET.Raptor.csproj` is `<VerifiedBy>benchmark</VerifiedBy>`, and
`docs/reference/features.md`'s RAPTOR row points at `MultiHopRagAnswerReproduction` instead of
saying *"Not yet `benchmark`"*. `dotnet build Rag.NET.slnx` 0 warnings; RepoConventions 94 passed,
0 failed.

**The two Phase 6.0 guards still report `[SKIP]`, and that is by design rather than a pass being
claimed for them.** `EveryDoneSectionSaysWhatExercisesIt` and `NoPackageStaysAtBareUnit` skip while
their allowlists are non-empty and fail on any *unlisted* violation — the "failing behind a work
list" shape 6.0 built. RAPTOR was in neither allowlist, so nothing was removed from one; what did
run and pass is the well-formedness assertion on the new `benchmark` pointer, plus both staleness
twins. **Do not read those two skips as green.**

**The guide states the hold, not just the number** — corpus scope measured *worse* than the
per-document tree it replaced, and the default nevertheless stays `Corpus` pending a second corpus
(see DECIDED 2026-08-27). Rather than a verdict, the guide gives a corpus-shaped rule: if your
questions resemble MultiHop-RAG's, set `PerDocument`; if your documents genuinely share themes,
`Corpus` is the paper's mechanism; either way measure your own corpus.

**What is next is a choice between threads, and nothing forces the order.** The phase now owes
HyDE, reranking, hybrid BM25, late chunking, SPLADE, ~~the three answer engines as arms~~ (**built
2026-08-28**, not yet merged, not yet run — see above), every vector
store through the SciFact parity leg, the second-corpus RAPTOR arm, and local search's unexplained
yes/no abstention. ~~**The recommendation is the pipeline-parity test**: it is fast-tier, needs no
corpus run and no model calls, closes the gap 5.2.2 named explicitly, and is the one remaining DoD
clause that is pure engineering.~~ **Built 2026-08-27 on `feat/pipeline-parity-test` (not yet
merged) — the fast leg only.** `OrderingEmbeddingGenerator`, `PipelineParity` and
`PipelineParityTests` compare a real `AddRagNet` pipeline against the harness's own dense row at
exact score equality; the fast leg runs a synthetic corpus on every push and passes. The mutation
check ran: the plan's suggested mutation, `UseMmr`, is a mathematical no-op on this fixture (the
query vector equals doc-0's vector by construction, so MMR's relevance and diversity terms cancel
exactly and reproduce the harness's order) — `UseRedundancyFilter = true` was used instead, since
adjacent fixture documents sit at cosine ≈0.975, above the 0.95 default threshold, and the check
failed with a named-rank, both-ids-and-scores message before the mutation was reverted. **The real
SciFact leg exists but has never run on this machine** — no ONNX model, no BEIR cache — and is
verified by reading only; a review caught it passing vacuously with zero hits on both sides before
merge, fixed with explicit corpus-landed and depth-of-hits assertions. **The next recommendation is
HyDE and reranking's re-measurement under the Real protocol** — both already have parity-corpus
cells, so they are re-measurements rather than new harness arms, and remain the cheapest
*measurement* threads open in the phase. `LateChunking` remains the most expensive: it has no
protocol and needs the token-level embedding path built before one can be written.

**~~Delete `GraphLocalSearchBehavior` and `PageRankWeight`~~ — MERGED 2026-08-27 in #408
(`c3e4aa94`), verified on `main` by content rather than by the PR's label.** The blend, its three
options properties
(`PageRankWeight`, `LocalSearchDepth`, `LocalTopEntities`) and its DI registration are gone from the
package; `GraphRagRetrievalOptions` is renamed `GraphRagGlobalSearchOptions`.

**The three pinned figures survived, and that was the whole design.** A frozen copy,
`LegacyPageRankLocalSearch`, lives in the measurement harness, and the figures were re-measured
through it *before* the original was deleted — the only moment that comparison was possible:
**0.56897/0.56897, 0.2102/0.2102, 2,255-of-2,255**, zero skips, zero model calls (35,296 extraction
requests replayed, embedding cache 325,661 hits / 0 misses). All three are now machine-asserted;
the ablation's was only *printed* before, so nothing would have failed if it regressed.

**The file count in the issue and in this file was wrong three times** — "17 files in four projects"
here, 19 in the design doc, **21 across five** in fact. Each low count came from grepping the two
*named* members; only the union of all seven targets finds `GraphGlobalSearchBehavior` and its
tests, which touch the renamed options type but never the deleted members.

**One item is unverified and gates nothing else:** the `Rag.NET.E2ETests` GraphRag tests never ran —
no Docker daemon on this machine. Their local-search assertion was rewritten (it demanded an entity
chunk that `GraphChunkRoutingBehavior` provably strips, with a failure message stating a diagnosis
#247's store separation had already made false) and that rewrite is verified only by reading.

**The corpus-scope default is decided** (2026-08-27, option 3 — see DECIDED below) and is no longer
blocking on a person. It is now scheduled work: a second-corpus RAPTOR arm.

**The measurement work still open in 6.2.1** is the 17 Done sections that need a pinned figure with
a control. **#176 is no longer on this list** — it was answered 2026-08-26 in #405, and the answer
needed no new measurement at all: the counts were already recorded and what was missing was reading
the dropped endpoints' *names*.

**There is no measurement run set up and waiting.** RAPTOR Task 5 is done, and the #300 follow-up
was done on 2026-08-18 (see Blockers). The 17 Done sections that still need a pinned figure with a
control mostly need a **new harness arm built first**. `SemanticChunking` **now exists** — #393 built it
and measured it, and the result is that it depends on document length: SciFact -0.00042, FiQA
-0.02577, ArguAna -0.02930, **TREC-COVID +0.06769**. `LateChunking` still has no protocol, and
needs the token-level embedding path before one can be written. The bottleneck for
6.2.1 is engineering now, not compute.

Historical context for the arms, retained: Historical context for the arms, retained: `RaptorOptions.MaxClusters` defaults to `null`, so before
#345's fix `SelectClusterCount` capped every level at `SelectK(maxK: Min(count, 10))` regardless of
corpus size — over MultiHop-RAG's 17,648 chunks the largest level-1 cluster held at least 1,765
chunks (≈183k tokens, uncapped in `ConcatenateChunkTexts`) against `gpt-4o-mini`'s 128k context, so
the corpus tree could not be built at the shipped default. **#345 merged to `main` 2026-08-22 in
#351 (`bb4c11c7`), verified on `main` by content — `TargetClusterSize` is present in
`RaptorOptions.cs` there — rather than by the PR's MERGED label.** `TargetClusterSize` floors the
cluster count; see `docs/guide/raptor.md`'s Cluster Size section for what it guarantees (an average
bound, not a per-cluster maximum). Task 4's pilot is the next thing to run.

**6.2.4 completed 2026-08-21** (#344), so `raptorboost` now measures a `Boost` that works.

Three things govern the run, all in the plan:

1. **`Corpus`-scope ingestion bypasses `RaptorIngestionBehavior.HandleAsync` entirely, then
   `RaptorTreeRebuilder.RebuildAsync()` is called exactly once.** Suppressing the growth debounce
   and letting ingestion run normally was the first approach and it does not work for a bulk load —
   the debounce's baseline resets to whatever the corpus held at the last build, so at the shipped
   `CorpusGrowthThreshold = 0.10` a 609-article corpus still triggers a rebuild partway through, and
   the trigger point depends on document order. `RaptorRun` instead writes each document's chunks
   straight to the leaf store and the vector store during ingestion, and the single rebuild after
   ingestion finishes is the only tree this run can produce. A fast-tier test asserts
   `RaptorRun.CorpusRebuildCount == 1` (not `TreeBuildCount` — the member is named
   `CorpusRebuildCount`) so a regression fails in milliseconds rather than in dollars; because that
   counter is set to 1 beside the one `RebuildAsync` call by construction, `LeafCount` and
   `SummariserCalls` are what actually prove nothing rebuilt along the way.
2. **Task 4's gate is real.** If `raptorfiltered − dense` is not ≈ 0 the corpora diverged and no
   figure means anything — stop, having spent a pilot rather than a sweep.
3. **`raptorcorpus` is RAPTOR's result, not `raptor`.** Publishing the per-document figure would
   repeat 5.2's misattribution, which cost three weeks and a revised published finding.

~~**Also unblocked and cheap:** deleting `GraphLocalSearchBehavior` and `PageRankWeight`.~~
**Merged 2026-08-27 in #408** — and it was not cheap: 21 files across five projects, six tasks, and
a plan that was wrong three times in ways only implementation exposed.

### Task 4 completed 2026-08-24 23:49 and the gate HELD.

**`raptorfiltered − dense = +0.0000` on all three scoring rules**, confirmed twice — the gate-only
run at 17:59 and the full five-arm run at 23:49. The corpora did not diverge, so the pilot's figures
measure RAPTOR rather than a setup fault. Merged 2026-08-25 in **#370**; full account in
`docs/plans/2026-08-21-raptor-pilot-notes.md`.

**The finding to carry into Task 5: `raptorcorpus − raptor = +0.0000`.** 6.2.3 shipped corpus-level
clustering as a *breaking* change, and at 50 queries it bought exactly nothing over the per-document
tree. Task 5's 2,556 queries is what decides whether that survives — the pilot's type mix is skewed
(11 temporal questions scoring 0.0000 in every arm, 6 nulls).

**Task 5 is costed from Step 4's counters rather than extrapolated: ~10,000 new generations, zero
tree-construction cost — both trees are cached — and roughly 8 hours.** That 8 hours is an estimate
built on a rate observed during *tree summarisation*, whose prompts are much larger than answer
generation's; it is not a throughput measurement of the work Task 5 actually does.

**No wall-clock figure from the pilot is quotable.** Two orphaned runners contaminated it — the real
pilot got 139 CPU-seconds in 58 minutes while they held 5.6 CPU-hours each. The gate is an accuracy
difference and Step 4's deliverables are counts, so both survive; the timing does not.

**Three defects were found, two of them in the plan itself:**

1. **The plan's `dotnet test --filter` is silently ignored.** This project sets
   `TestingPlatformDotnetTestSupport` with `xunit.v3`, so the VSTest filter is discarded and **all
   25 test classes run** — with `RAGNET_BEIR_LONG_RUNS=1` and `RAGNET_GRAPHRAG_ANSWERS_GENERATE=1`
   set, which unlocks every expensive test in the project. Nothing fails; a run was observed
   executing library-comparison sweeps instead of RAPTOR. **Fixed in the plan** — both Task 4 and
   Task 5 now invoke the runner directly with `-class '*BeirGraphRagAnswerTests*'`, and verify it
   selects 5 methods before running.

2. **The plan's cost model counted only answers.** It estimated "50 queries × 4 arms, most hitting
   cache" (~250 calls) and **omitted tree construction entirely**. The `raptor` arm is the
   per-document control, so it builds **609 trees**, every level an LLM summarisation: 4,739 calls
   in 5 hours at a steady 21/min, with ~15-20 hours and order $10-20 still to go. **Fixed in the
   plan**, and `raptor` is now dropped from Task 4's pilot — the gate needs corpus-scope arms only,
   and the corpus tree is already cached.

3. **Killing a run by `dotnet`/`testhost` does not stop it.** The process is named after the
   assembly. Two "stopped" runs survived and were found 90 minutes later at 5.6 CPU-hours and
   6.2 GB *each*, starving their replacement — which managed 139 CPU-seconds in 58 minutes. This
   was already recorded in memory before it happened, and happened anyway.

**This is not #333 recurring, and that was checked rather than assumed.** `SelectClusterCount`
computes `k = Min(raw, count - 1)` and returns null at `k <= 1`, so every level shrinks strictly and
the loop provably terminates. The `k >= count` degenerate guard remains unreachable. The clustering
is correct; there is simply far more legitimate work than the plan priced.

**Next step is the gate, and it is cheap:** run Task 4 with
`dense,raptorcorpus,raptorfiltered,raptorboost` and check `raptorfiltered − dense ≈ 0`. Only after
it holds does the ~15-20 hour per-document `raptor` build earn its place as a scheduled job.

### Task 5 ran 2026-08-25 and reversed the pilot's headline.

**The validation gate held exactly at full scale.** `raptorfiltered` reproduced the dense arm to
four decimals on all three rules — 0.3499 / 0.2603 / 0.3242, the figures pinned 2026-08-15 — so the
corpora did not diverge and the numbers below measure RAPTOR rather than a setup fault.

| arm | paper | raw | strict | inference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `raptor` (per-document control) | **0.3734** | **0.2860** | **0.3348** | **0.8309** |
| `raptorcorpus` (shipped default) | 0.3588 | 0.2656 | 0.3322 | 0.7831 |
| `raptorfiltered` (the gate) | 0.3499 | 0.2603 | 0.3242 | 0.7721 |
| `raptorboost` | 0.3450 | 0.2634 | 0.3086 | 0.7757 |

Over the **2,255 judged queries** — the denominator every other pin uses; the 301 nulls are scored
separately as abstention.

**`raptorcorpus − raptor = −0.0146 paper, −0.0204 raw, −0.0027 strict.` Corpus-level clustering is
worse than the per-document tree it replaced.** McNemar over the paired judged queries: paper
p=0.0247 (85 corpus wins against 118 per-document), raw p=0.0006 (62 against 108), strict p=0.7372.
Two of three rules significant, all three signed the same way.

**The 50-query pilot put this at +0.0000 and was underpowered** — which is exactly what Task 5
existed to find out, and the reason the plan insisted on the full sweep rather than trusting the
pilot's headline.

**The gap is inference queries**: 0.7831 against the control's 0.8309, while comparison and temporal
are flat. That is the *opposite* of #331's rationale — corpus-spanning summaries were meant to help
the multi-hop case they measurably hurt.

**`raptorboost − raptorcorpus` = −0.0137 paper (p=0.0073), −0.0235 strict (p=0.0000).** 6.2.4 fixed
`Boost` so it could promote summaries at all; this is the first measurement of what it does once it
works, and it trades accuracy for abstention (51.8% correct null-abstention, the best of the four).

**Cost and shape:** 58 m of generation after a 28 m I/O-bound load, ~5,600 new answers. The plan's
~8 h estimate came from a rate observed during *tree summarisation*, whose prompts are much larger;
the pilot notes flagged that uncertainty explicitly and it was right to.

## DECIDED 2026-08-27 — the corpus-scope default waits on a second corpus

`RaptorTreeScope.Corpus` is the shipped default and a breaking change (#331, phase 6.2.3). Task 5
measured it as **worse** than the per-document tree it replaced — −0.0146 paper (p=0.0247), −0.0204
raw (p=0.0006), strict a wash (p=0.7372) — with the gap concentrated in **inference** queries
(0.7831 against the control's 0.8309), which is the exact multi-hop case #331 argued it would help.

**The operator's decision, 2026-08-27, is option 3: measure a second corpus before changing
anything.** The three options were:

1. Revert the default to `PerDocument` and keep `Corpus` opt-in. *(Not taken.)*
2. Keep the default and document the measured cost. *(Not taken.)*
3. **Measure a second corpus before deciding.** ← **taken**

**The reasoning is the reason the other two were refused, and it is worth keeping:** a single
dataset reversing a design decision is thin evidence, and **MultiHop-RAG rewards per-document
locality by construction** — its questions are built by composing facts drawn from identifiable
source articles, so a per-document tree is measuring on home ground. Two of three rules signing the
same way is real, but it is real *on this corpus*, and the corpus is not neutral about the thing
being tested. Reverting a breaking default on it would be acting on the least neutral evidence
available.

**So the default stays `Corpus` for now, and that is a hold rather than an endorsement.** Nothing
has been changed on the strength of the Task 5 numbers, and nothing should be until a second corpus
reports. Two of three rules are significant against it; if the second corpus signs the same way, the
revert becomes well-founded rather than corpus-shaped.

**What this adds to 6.2.1:** a second-corpus RAPTOR arm, needing a dataset whose questions are not
constructed per-document. `BeirDatasetDescriptor` already has the shape. This is now a named thread
in the phase, not an open question — the question is answered and the work is scheduled.

**Cost note carried from Task 5:** the full sweep was 58 m of generation after a 28 m I/O-bound load
for ~5,600 new answers. A second corpus is that order again, not the ~8 h the original plan
estimated — that figure came from a rate observed during tree *summarisation*, whose prompts are
much larger than answer generation's.

**Last landed on `main`:** **#491** as `94a3d86d` (2026-09-07) — the BM25 doc-id allocator, closing
#490 and #487. Verify by content: `AddWithId` in `InMemoryBm25Index.cs`. Before it, in order:
**#489** (#337's variance floor), **#488** (#336), **#486** (#338), **#485** (an unrelated
provider fix — StefH's #435, which closes no issue automatically), and **#484** (the MCP write
surface, #198).

**These four attributions were each off by one when first written on 2026-09-07, and were corrected
the same day.** The commit that introduced them argued this file must be trustworthy; it then
misattributed every fix it listed, because the list was written from memory of the session rather
than from `git log`. **Read a PR number here as a claim to check, not a fact** — `gh pr view <n>
--json closingIssuesReferences` answers it in one command, and `git log --oneline origin/main`
shows which PR carried which subject.

**Verifying a removal needs a scoped grep.** `GetNextBm25DocId` was deleted in #491, but a bare
`git grep -l` for it on `origin/main` returns **14 files** and reads like a failed removal. Every one
is a dated record under `docs/plans/`, where it correctly survives as history. Restricted to
`src tests benchmarks` it returns none. **Scope the grep to where the symbol would matter before
concluding anything from its count** — in either direction.

Before them, **#471** as `b014217d` (2026-09-06) — metadata extraction measured on two
corpora. Verify by content: `98.79` in `BeirMetadataExtractionTests.cs`. Before it **#476** as
`2342df31` — deep research, and the `ResponseFormat` cache fix; verify by content:
`RenderResponseFormat` in `CachedGraphRagClient.cs`. **Both verified on `main` by content rather
than by a MERGED label**, and #471 needed a conflict resolved that no label would have surfaced:
both PRs deleted adjacent lines from `SectionsAwaitingExercise`, and taking either side would have
silently resurrected a discharged entry.

Before them, **#470** as `e2d5f39c` (2026-09-05) — the 120-chunk metadata-extraction
pilot, and the silent coverage gap it found before the full run was funded. Verify by content:
`BeirMetadataExtractionPilotTests` under `tests/Rag.NET.Benchmarks.Quality.IntegrationTests/`, and
`RAGNET_METADATA_EXTRACTION_GENERATE` in `docs/reference/ci.md`.

**This field was EIGHTEEN PRs stale when this session opened — the eleventh occurrence**, and the
largest gap yet. It named #452 (`d7d20666`) while `main` carried #470; everything from #453 to #470
had landed in between. The note above held again: `git branch --show-current` and a content check
against `main` were both right, and this field was wrong. **The eleventh occurrence is not new
information about forgetfulness — it is the tenth confirmation that a mutable pointer in a file
nobody edits at merge time cannot be maintained.** Update it only when new work lands.

Before it, **#452** as `d7d20666` (2026-09-03) — late chunking measured on three
corpora, and the `MaxTokens` shipped defect it exposed. Verify by content: `MaxTokens { get; set; }
= 256` in `src/Rag.NET.Embeddings.Onnx/OnnxTokenEmbeddingOptions.cs`, and the pinned `0.65510` in
`BeirReproduction.cs`.

Before it, in order: **#451** `b3e7473b` hybrid BM25 on three corpora; **#450** `784d3b5c` the nine
`Delivered` sections normalised so the exercise guard can see them; **#449** `9ed26ff8` the HyDE
pipeline-parity test and `QueryTechniques` discharged; **#448** `fd0f8f48` `AnswerEngines`
discharged; **#446** `93134872` ArguAna reranking and the retraction of "parity predicts the sign";
**#444** `8fb7f00a` the three-corpora scope decision.

**Twelve PRs merged across 2026-09-02 and 2026-09-03**, each verified on `main` by content rather
than by a MERGED label.

**This field was seven PRs stale when the session closed — the tenth occurrence of the pattern its
own note above describes.** It goes stale at the moment work merges, which is the moment nobody is
editing this file. The note says to derive the branch with `git branch --show-current` and check
`main` by content; that advice held every time it was followed and this field still drifted whenever
several PRs landed in one sitting.

Before it, **#442** as `05943fff` — FiQA HyDE at 0.34683, and the correction to what SciFact's cell
had been read to mean. Verify by content: `0.34683` in the same file.

Before it, **#441** as `da22a05e` — the roadmap record for HyDE and the scoped gate. Verify by
content: `HyDE's thread completed 2026-09-02` in `docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`.

Before them, **#433** as `e4923341` — HyDE and reranking measured over Rag.NET's own chunking, plus
the fix for the branch's day-old red CI — and **#439** as `f66b1677`, `RAGNET_BEIR_LONG_RUNS` scoped
to named datasets. Verify by content: `UnderCachedHyde_` (underscore load-bearing) and `IsOptedInFor`
in `BeirRunBudget.cs`.

**Five PRs merged 2026-09-02, each verified on `main` by content rather than by a MERGED label.**
Merged main re-run after the first two: 225 tests, 0 failed, 94 skipped.

Before them, **#431** as `8b2e0124` (2026-08-31) — `mapreduce` pinned at 0.6483, a null result, and
the DoD's answer-engine clause closed. Before it **#430** (`ced43abb`) and **#425** (`3640637b`).

**This field was five PRs stale when this session opened** — it named #429 while `main` carried
#425, #430 and #431 — which is the ninth occurrence of the pattern the note above describes. It went
stale the same way as always: at the moment work merged, which is the moment nobody is editing this
file.

Before it, **#419** as `50221812` (2026-08-29) — the FLARE contract-and-cache fix.
Verify by content: `FragmentProtocol` in `src/Rag.NET.AnswerEngines/FlareAnswerEngine.cs`,
`ThrowIfUnkeyable` in
`benchmarks/Rag.NET.Benchmarks.Quality.GraphExtractions/CachedGraphRagClient.cs`.

Before it, **#418** as `e7563873` (2026-08-29) — gives every engine arm the judge's
extraction contract as `RagOptions.SystemPrompt`. Verify by content:
`SystemPrompt = MultiHopRagAnswerJudge.AnswerInstruction` appears in
`tests/Rag.NET.Benchmarks.Quality.IntegrationTests/BeirGraphRagAnswerTests.cs`. This field was stale
by two PRs (#417 `b5a48a94`, #418 `e7563873`) when this session opened; corrected then.

Before it, **#417** as `b5a48a94` — fixed this field the previous time and recorded what the
provisioned machine measured. Before that, **#416** as `d2d96b0d` (2026-08-28) — the five
answer-engine arms and their pilot gates (`AnswerEngineArms.cs`, `AnswerEngineArmsTests.cs` under
`tests/Rag.NET.Benchmarks.Quality.IntegrationTests/`, `chatengine` in `AnswerArm.cs`).

**#419 landed on `main` 2026-08-29 as `50221812`, verified by content** — `FragmentProtocol` and
`ThrowIfUnkeyable` are both present there — **rather than by the PR's MERGED label.** #418 broke
FLARE — a terminal `SystemPrompt` fighting FLARE's own fragment protocol produced an 86,091-byte
runaway, 23× the historical maximum, because `CachedGraphRagClient` also discarded FLARE's
`MaxOutputTokens` guard. Twelve commits fix the fragment protocol, the cache
key (a new optional field, omitted rather than emptied, so all 86,510 existing entries keep their
keys), the client's option-forwarding, and the harness's contract application. A re-run pilot,
2026-08-29, passed 15/15 with 0 skipped, and every engine arm now meets the judge's extraction
contract on 8 or 9 of 9 queries (up from 0 of 9). Full account in
`docs/planning/ROADMAP.md`'s 6.2.1 block and `docs/plans/2026-08-29-flare-contract-pilot-notes.md`.

**This paragraph said "Not on `main`… in flight, not merged" until #419 merged, which is the eighth
time a claim in this file has been falsified at the exact moment its branch landed.** It was true
when written and inverted an hour later. The Working State field above was redesigned to be immutable
for precisely this reason; prose elsewhere in the file is not, so a merge-status sentence anywhere
but that field is a liability with a short shelf life.

**Nothing here needs updating when a branch merges** — only when new work lands, which is the moment
someone is already editing this file.

## Measured 2026-08-28 — the machine was provisioned all along

**Both things this session called unmeasurable were measurable.** `~/.cache/ragnet-beir` holds the
corpus, `model.onnx`, `vocab.txt` and 256 embedding shards, and ships an `env.sh` that points the
harness at them. The tests skip because **no environment variable is set**, not because anything is
missing — and three sessions read that skip as "this machine cannot measure" and wrote it into the
record. Source `env.sh` before writing *unprovisioned* anywhere.

- **Pipeline parity, both legs: PASS**, zero skipped, 90.5 s. The SciFact leg ran for the first time —
  20 queries, real ONNX embedder, `AblationRow.Dense` against a real `AddRagNet` pipeline over one
  shared store, chunk ids and exact scores identical at every rank. **The sixteen default retrieval
  behaviours are no-ops on real data**, which until now was asserted only by reading.
- **Answer-engine pilot, 10 queries, 6 arms: PASS**, 15 tests, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 41 m (most of it
  cache-replayed graph construction). All three gates held first time, including the lookahead gate
  whose guarantee had been wrong in four successive versions.
- **FLARE measured at ~11 calls per query against a ceiling of 33**, so the full sweep is on the
  order of $5–10 rather than the derived $4–$21. Full reading in `ROADMAP.md`'s 6.2.1 entry.
- **The predicted format-versus-reasoning confound is real and visible in the answers**: `dense`
  answers "Trump" and scores correct where every engine answers discursively and scores wrong. No
  accuracy headline is published from nine queries.

**The seven occurrences are recorded below and are left as written.** They are the evidence that
the field was structurally broken rather than repeatedly forgotten, and the reason it was replaced
above rather than re-filled an eighth time.

**It was stale again when this session opened, for the sixth time.** The field named
`chore/reconcile-408-and-raptor-task-6` while the checkout was already on
`feat/pipeline-parity-test`, and that earlier branch had *also* already shipped: it squash-merged to
`main` as **#412** (`ab87d156`) on 2026-08-27 — the same PR that, per its own commit message, was
itself fixing the field's *fifth* stale occurrence. Verified on `main` by content — `## Measured` is
in `docs/guide/raptor.md`, `<VerifiedBy>benchmark</VerifiedBy>` is in `Rag.NET.Raptor.csproj` — rather
than by the PR's MERGED label. **Six for six: this field has now gone stale every single time the
branch it named has merged, and only ever at that moment, because that is the one moment nobody is
editing this file.** Read it against `git branch --show-current` and against `origin/main` by
content before trusting either — a session that trusts this field's story of its own branch is
trusting the one claim in the file structurally guaranteed to be checked last.

**It was stale again when this session's predecessor opened, for the fifth time — and so was the
step below it.** The field named `chore/planning-176-and-phase-table` while the checkout was on
`refactor/delete-pagerank-local-search`, and that branch had *also* already shipped: **PR #408
squash-merged to `main` as `c3e4aa94` on 2026-08-27**, verified on `main` by content —
`GraphRagGlobalSearchOptions.cs` present, `PageRankWeight` gone from `src/` (the one surviving
mention is a doc comment in `LocalSearchContextBuilder`), `LegacyPageRankLocalSearch` named in the
GraphRag csproj's IVT comment — rather than by the PR's MERGED label. **The pattern is now exact
and worth naming: this field, and the Recommended Next Step under it, both go stale at the moment
the branch they describe merges, which is the one moment nobody is editing this file.** Read both
against `git branch --show-current` and against `origin/main` by content before trusting either.

**The fourth time, recorded 2026-08-27, read as follows.** It named
`chore/roadmap-6-2-11` while the checkout was on `research/176-dropped-endpoints`, and *that* branch
had already shipped: its two commits were squash-merged as **#404** and **#405** under different
SHAs, so `git log origin/<branch>..HEAD` showed nothing pushed while the work was on `main` all
along. **Verified on `main` by content** — `DescribeDroppedEndpoints` is in
`GraphRagFunctionsTests.cs` and `Phase 6.2.12` is in `ROADMAP.md` there — rather than by either PR's
label. The lesson generalises the one already recorded: a branch that *looks* unpushed is no more
trustworthy than a PR that *looks* merged. Diff the branch against `origin/main` by content before
concluding either way; here the only difference was main's own newer anglesharp bump (#406).

**Tasks 1-4 of `docs/plans/2026-08-21-raptor-real-protocol-implementation.md` are on `main`** —
Tasks 1-3 in #347 (`c2d83075`), Task 4 in #370 (`2de9c5c9`); verified by content, not by a MERGED
label. **Task 5 is unblocked and not started.**

**This field has now named a stale branch three times** (`chore/complete-phase-6-2-3`,
`bench/raptor-measurement`, `bench/raptor-real-protocol-measurement` — each still named here after
its PR merged). It goes stale at exactly the moment its branch merges, which is the moment nobody is
editing this file. **Re-read it against `git branch --show-current` before trusting it**, and treat
a mismatch as evidence the rest of this file may also predate the last merge — on 2026-08-25 it did,
by five phases.

**Issues from the 6.2.3 work:** #331, #332, #333 fixed and auto-closed on merge. **#336 and #338 are
CLOSED as of 2026-09-07; #337 is partly fixed.** They stood deferred "by decision" for two weeks, and
the decision was reversed once pre-1.0 was recognised as the moment to take the breaking changes they
needed. **`docs/guide/raptor.md`'s Known Limitations was brought up to date and this warning outlived it.**
That page now opens with "Most of what this section once listed is now fixed" and marks #338, #336
and #487 resolved with what each fix could *not* do. Corrected 2026-09-15 during a documentation
audit. It does not mention #337, whose near-duplicate facet is still open — the one thing here
still worth checking against.

- **#338 — CLOSED** in #486. `DeleteAsync` ignored the leaf store, so a deleted document's text could
  be re-read, summarised and stored as searchable content under `raptor://corpus-tree` —
  untraceable and undeletable, live on the default path. Fixed by `IDocumentScopedStore` in core,
  which is the abstraction this entry predicted would be needed. **The entry's framing was wrong in
  one respect:** the purge was described as an exception to `Overwrite` stranding, and the first test
  written from that framing failed with zero calls, because `Overwrite` defaults to false.
- **#336 — CLOSED** in #488. Corpus summaries accumulated in the BM25 index on every
  ingest-triggered rebuild, and `RebuildAsync` bypassed BM25 entirely. **The issue's own preferred
  fix was not taken** — it would have removed summaries from BM25 altogether, changing what
  retrieval can find.
- **#337 — PARTLY FIXED** in #489. The absolute `1e-6` is gone, replaced by a scale-relative floor,
  `max(1e-12, 0.001 x mean variance)`. **Still open:** the near-duplicate characterisation. The
  fraction the issue suggested broke four existing guards; the shipped value came from measurement.
- **#487 and #490 — CLOSED** in #491, and neither existed when this section was written. Both were
  found by asking why #336's rebuilder could not write to BM25. The allocator beneath it handed out
  ids the index already held after a restart, and `Add` dropped the chunk on collision, so **every
  document ingested after a restart was missing from keyword and hybrid search** at shipped
  defaults. A third instance in `GraphProjectionRebuilder` was never filed — found only by looking
  at the sibling.

**Carry this into 6.1 and 6.2's remaining `unit` packages.** 6.2.3 found three separate test-fixture
defects, each of which made a real failure unreachable while the suite stayed green. `VerifiedBy=unit`
did not mean *untested*; it meant *the fakes could not produce inputs that fail*. Two shipped
defects and one unbounded-spend infinite loop survived in a published package because of it.
