# Security

The security layer adds three independent, composable features to a Rag.NET pipeline:

- **RBAC on chunks** — filters retrieved chunks to those the current caller is allowed to see.
- **PII detection and redaction** — scrubs personal data from chunk text at ingest time, before embeddings are stored.
- **Audit log** — records every retrieval and answer event to a SQLite database for compliance and forensics.

All three are opt-in. Register any combination of them through the `RagBuilder` API. They have no mandatory coupling — you can use the audit log without RBAC, or PII redaction without the audit log.

## Security posture

**Rag.NET is a RAG library with opt-in security features, not a security product.** Everything on
this page is off until you register it. This section states what the project claims, what it leaves
to you, and where its current dependency advisories stand — read it before the feature guides below.

### The four families, and where each is documented

| Family | Defends against | Documented |
|---|---|---|
| RBAC on chunks | a caller retrieving chunks they should not see | [below](#rbac-on-chunks) |
| PII detection and redaction | personal data reaching the vector store | [below](#pii-detection-and-redaction) |
| Audit log | having no record of what was retrieved or answered | [below](#audit-log) |
| Prompt-injection defences — chunk and query sanitisation, retrieval guards, prompt hardening | attacker-controlled content hijacking the model at query time | [below](#prompt-injection-defences) |

All four families are documented on this page. The feature reference carries the shorter
[Prompt Injection Fortification](../reference/features.md) entry for the same subject.

### Defaults that fail open

**Two features on this page do nothing by default when the metadata they depend on is absent.**
Both are deliberate, both are documented in their own sections, and both will silently protect
nothing if you register them over content that was ingested before you did.

#### RBAC: untagged chunks are world-readable

> Chunks that do not carry the key are world-readable and pass through for every caller.

A chunk without an `allowed_roles` metadata key is visible to everyone. **If you register RBAC
expecting deny-by-default, you do not have it.**

This is deliberate. The alternative — deny anything untagged — would hide every previously-ingested
chunk the moment RBAC is registered on an existing corpus, turning a security feature into a silent
outage. Tagging at ingest is the mechanism, and untagged content is treated as public because that
is what it was before you turned the feature on.

If you need deny-by-default, tag every document at ingest and treat an untagged chunk as a bug in
your ingestion, not in your retrieval.

#### Trust levels: untagged chunks are `internal`

`UseTrustLevelGuard` reads a `trust_level` metadata key and **treats its absence as `internal`** —
the most trusted value. Registered over a corpus ingested without trust tagging, it drops nothing.

Same reasoning as RBAC, same consequence: the feature is real, and it protects exactly the content
you tagged. See [`UseTrustLevelGuard` treats untagged content as trusted](#usetrustlevelguard-treats-untagged-content-as-trusted).

**A third thing worth knowing, which is narrower scope rather than a fail-open default:**
`UseQuerySanitiser` applies to `AskAsync` and `AskStreamingAsync` and **not to `RetrieveAsync`** — so
a retrieval-only caller gets no query sanitisation. See
[`UseQuerySanitiser` does not apply to `RetrieveAsync`](#usequerysanitiser-does-not-apply-to-retrieveasync).

### What the library does not do

It filters retrieved chunks, redacts at ingest, records an audit trail, and sanitises text. It does
**not**:

- **authenticate your end users** — you supply an `ICallerContext`; the library never establishes who
  the caller is,
- **encrypt anything at rest** — that belongs to your vector store and your disk,
- **manage keys or secrets** — API keys are read from your configuration,
- **secure the backing store** — an unsecured Qdrant or pgvector reachable from the internet is
  reachable whatever this library does.

### The hosting surfaces force an authentication decision

Four packages expose a network surface: `Rag.NET.Api`, `Rag.NET.Api.Grpc`, `Rag.NET.Mcp` and
`Rag.NET.Mcp.AspNetCore`. `Rag.NET.Mcp.Tool` is a self-contained executable of the same server,
configured from `appsettings.json` or the environment.

`Rag.NET.Api.Client` and `Rag.NET.Api.Grpc.Client` consume rather than serve, and their security
relevance is the mirror image: **they hold the API key.** Where it comes from, how it reaches the
process, and whether it ends up in a log or a crash dump are the consuming application's
responsibility — the clients read it from the configuration you give them and send it on every
call.

**None of them serves an unauthenticated surface by accident**, and the two mechanisms differ:

- **`Rag.NET.Mcp.AspNetCore`** attaches its API-key filter to the same convention builder that maps
  the endpoints, so "mapped but unauthenticated" is not expressible. `MapRagNetMcp` throws if the
  transport was never configured.
- **`Rag.NET.Api`** cannot do that — registration and mapping happen on two builders that cannot see
  each other — so `MapRagNetApi` detects instead, throwing when options are missing, when the
  authentication middleware is absent, and when any of its routes has been made auth-exempt.

`AllowAnonymous` exists on the MCP transport as a real opt-out for a host already behind an
authenticating gateway. The guard separates *someone decided this* from *nobody thought about it*;
it does not make the anonymous case impossible.

**The limitation worth knowing: the API key is a shared secret, not an identity.** Every client
presenting it is indistinguishable from every other, and there is no revocation short of changing
the key and redeploying everything that holds it. It is a deployment boundary, not an authorization
model — use it behind a gateway that does identity if you need per-client control.

### Dependency advisories

As of 2026-09-11 the repository carries five open Dependabot advisories. **None of them is in the
dependency closure of any published NuGet package.**

| Package | Severity | Where it lives | Patch |
|---|---|---|---|
| `image-size` (×2) | high | Docusaurus, which builds this documentation site | none available |
| `nltk` | high | `benchmarks/library-comparison-python/`, a comparison harness | none available |
| `qs` (×2) | medium | `webpack-dev-server`, reached only by `npm start` | pinned to 6.16.0 here |

If you install any Rag.NET package, none of the above enters your dependency graph — they belong to
this repository's own tooling. The two unpatched advisories have no fix available upstream; the one
that did has been pinned in `package.json`'s `overrides` block.

## Watching the model boundary

**Every security feature on this page acts before the model is called.** Sanitisers run at ingest and
before retrieval, guards run on retrieved chunks, prompt hardening runs at assembly. Nothing in
Rag.NET inspects what comes *back*.

`IConfidenceScorer` looks like it might, and does not: it scores whether a sentence is **supported by
the retrieved context**, on a 0–1 scale, and fails open at `1.0` when it cannot score. That is a
groundedness signal for answer quality. It is not an inspection of the response for a secret.

The concrete consequence: **a credential that survives ingest-time redaction, sits in a chunk, and
gets summarised back to a user is not seen by any part of this library.**

### The shape of the answer

Rag.NET resolves `IChatClient` from DI. Anything that decorates `IChatClient` therefore sits between
Rag.NET and the model, and sees both directions — the prompt as sent, and the response as returned.
That is the insertion point for a monitor, and it needs nothing from Rag.NET: no package reference,
no abstraction, no integration.

### A worked example

[AI.Sentinel](https://github.com/MarcelRoozekrans/AI.Sentinel) is one such monitor — `IChatClient`
middleware that scans both directions through a detector pipeline and can block, alert or log.

> **Disclosure:** AI.Sentinel is written by the same author as Rag.NET. It is named here because it
> is a concrete example that was actually tested against this library, not because Rag.NET depends
> on it or recommends it over alternatives. Any `IChatClient` decorator composes the same way.

```csharp
// 1. The monitor, wrapping your provider client.
//    Severity policy and detector configuration are AI.Sentinel's own -- see its documentation.
services.AddAISentinel(opts => { /* ... */ });
services.AddChatClient(new OpenAIChatClient(/* ... */)).UseAISentinel();

// 2. Rag.NET afterwards. The order matters -- see below.
services.AddRagNet(b => b
    .UseRbac()
    .UseCostBudgeting(o => o.DailyLimit = 10m));
```

### Register the monitor first

**Rag.NET's own `IChatClient` decorators rewrite the DI descriptor, so they can only wrap what is
already registered.** `UseCostBudgeting` and `UseFallbackChain` both do this. Register your monitor
*after* them and Rag.NET's decorator wraps nothing.

That is not silent. Resolving the pipeline throws:

> UseCostBudgeting is not applied to the IChatClient this container resolves. It decorates whatever
> is registered at the moment it runs, and this IChatClient was registered (or replaced) afterwards,
> so the feature UseCostBudgeting configures is silently absent. Move the UseCostBudgeting call after
> the IChatClient registration. This is checked when the RAG pipeline is resolved because a
> registration made later cannot be seen at registration time.

**Two details worth knowing**, both measured on 2026-09-11:

- **The check runs when the pipeline is resolved, not when `IChatClient` is.** Resolving the chat
  client alone succeeds and hands back the bare monitor, so a smoke test that only resolves
  `IChatClient` will report a composition that is in fact broken. Resolve `IRagPipeline`.
- **In the correct order, Rag.NET's decorators wrap around the monitor** — the resolved client is
  `CostTrackingChatClient` → your monitor → your provider. That is the right nesting: the monitor
  sits closest to the model, so it sees the prompt exactly as sent and the response exactly as
  returned.

### What overlaps, and what that costs

A monitor is not purely additive with the defences on this page.

| | Rag.NET | A model-boundary monitor |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt injection | query sanitisers, retrieval guards, prompt hardening — **before** the call | detectors on the assembled prompt — **at** the call |
| PII | redacted at ingest, before embedding | detected in the response |
| Credentials in a response | **not covered** | covered |
| Groundedness | `IConfidenceScorer` against retrieved context | hallucination detectors |

**Prompt injection is covered twice, by different means.** Whether that is defence in depth or
duplicated cost depends on your configuration — two LLM-backed passes over every query is a real
expense. Rag.NET's regex sanitisers are cheap; its LLM sanitiser and a monitor's LLM-escalating
detectors are not. Decide deliberately rather than enabling both because each page recommends it.

### Verify detection against your own configuration

**Registration is not protection, and the two look identical from outside.** A monitor with detectors
registered but a dependency unset — an embedding generator, a classifier client — can scan clean and
report nothing wrong. That was observed in a bare configuration during the 2026-09-11 testing, with
injection detectors present.

Send a known-bad prompt through your configured pipeline and confirm it is caught, before relying on
it. This applies to Rag.NET's own sanitisers equally.

### Version compatibility, as measured

AI.Sentinel 2.0.1 targets `net8.0`/`net9.0` while Rag.NET targets `net10.0`, and it builds against
`ZeroAlloc.Mediator` 4.1.4 and `ZeroAlloc.ValueObjects` 1.7.1 where Rag.NET pins 5.0.1 and 2.0.5 —
two major versions apart, which NuGet resolves in favour of the higher.

**Verified on 2026-09-11 against those exact versions**: the container builds, `IChatClient` resolves
to `SentinelChatClient`, 55 detectors resolve and construct, and a scan completes without
`MissingMethodException` or `TypeLoadException`.

**What that check does not cover:** it exercised construction and the scan path, not every detector's
internals. A detector reaching a changed API only on an alert path was not reached. Both packages
move independently, so treat this as a dated observation rather than a standing guarantee, and re-run
it for the versions you actually deploy.

## Prompt injection defences

Indirect prompt injection is the primary security risk specific to RAG: attacker-controlled content —
a document, a scraped page, an email — carries instructions that hijack the model when a query happens
to retrieve it. The content is data to you and instructions to the model.

`Rag.NET.Security` defends in four layers. **They are only comprehensible positionally**, so this
table is in pipeline order rather than alphabetical:

| Layer | Interface | Registration | Runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chunk sanitisation | `IChunkSanitiser` | `UseChunkSanitiser` / `UseLlmChunkSanitiser` | at ingest, before embedding |
| Query sanitisation | `IQuerySanitiser` | `UseQuerySanitiser` / `UseLlmQuerySanitiser` | before retrieval |
| Retrieval guards | `IRetrievalGuard` | `UseRetrievalGuard` / `UseTrustLevelGuard` | on retrieved chunks |
| Prompt hardening | answer-engine decorator | `UsePromptHardening` | at answer assembly |

All are opt-in and independent. Registering none of them is the default.

### Two extension points you already know

**`UseRbac` registers an `IRetrievalGuard`.** `RbacRetrievalGuard` is the same kind of object as
`RegexRetrievalGuard` and `TrustLevelRetrievalGuard`, in the same chain — so RBAC and the injection
guards compose by registration order like any other chain, and there is no separate "RBAC pipeline"
to reason about.

**`IChunkSanitiser` is shared with PII redaction.** `UsePiiDetection` and `UseChunkSanitiser` register
into the same ordered chain, so the chaining rules in
[Chaining regex and LLM detection](#chaining-regex-and-llm-detection) apply unchanged — sanitisers run
in registration order, and each sees the previous one's output.

### The regex/LLM pairing

Three of the four layers ship a cheap deterministic implementation and an expensive semantic one,
registerable independently or together. This is the same shape as
[PII detection](#pii-detection-and-redaction), and the same trade-off: regex is free and literal, the
LLM variant costs a model call per item and catches paraphrase.

The regex implementations share **one pattern**, case-insensitive with a 1000 ms match timeout. It
targets role-switch phrases (`ignore previous instructions`, `you are now`, `act as`, `disregard`,
`new instructions`, `system prompt`) and delimiter injection (`<|system|>`, `<|user|>`, `[INST]`,
`### instruction`). Matches are replaced with `[REDACTED]` and logged with the matched pattern.

**They fail open.** If sanitisation throws — a regex timeout on a pathological input, an LLM call
failing — the original text is returned unchanged and the failure is logged. A sanitiser that threw
would take the whole request down; one that returns unsanitised text does not, and says so in the
log. The `Use*Llm*` variants resolve `IChatClient` from DI and throw at container resolution if none
is registered.

### `UseQuerySanitiser` does not apply to `RetrieveAsync`

Query sanitisation is applied by a pipeline decorator that wraps `AskAsync` and `AskStreamingAsync`.
**`RetrieveAsync` forwards the query unchanged.**

If you use Rag.NET for retrieval only — fetching chunks and generating elsewhere — registering
`UseQuerySanitiser` has no effect on that path. There is a reasonable argument for it: injection
hijacks a model, `RetrieveAsync` reaches none, and redacting `act as` from a legitimate query about
acting would cost recall for no security gain. Sanitise at your own generation boundary if that is
where your model call happens.

### `UseTrustLevelGuard` treats untagged content as trusted

A chunk with no `trust_level` metadata is read as **`internal`** — the most trusted value. So
registering the guard over a corpus that was ingested without trust tagging **drops nothing**, and
does so silently.

This is the same shape as [RBAC's world-readable default](#defaults-that-fail-open), and for the same
reason: a guard that hid every untagged chunk the moment it was registered would turn a security
feature into an outage.

`trust_level` is set at ingest, by whatever pulls the content — a web crawler or email connector
should mark what it fetches as `external` or `untrusted`. `TrustLevelGuardOptions` then decides what
happens: `DropUntrusted` (default `true`) removes `untrusted` chunks, and `WarnOnExternal` (default
`true`) logs when `external` ones are retrieved.

### Prompt hardening

`UsePromptHardening` decorates the answer engine with a system prefix instructing the model to treat
retrieved content strictly as data. The default says so explicitly; `PromptHardeningOptions.SystemPrefix`
replaces it.

This is the layer that assumes the others leaked. It costs nothing per request and is the cheapest
thing on this page.

### Confirming a guard actually ran

Both retrieval guards emit a `ragnet.security.guard` activity carrying `security.guard.type`
(`regex`, `trustlevel`) and `security.guard.action` (`redact`, `drop`). Redactions and drops are also
logged with the document id.

**Registration is not protection** — a guard registered over untagged content, or a sanitiser whose
pattern does not match your attacker, is silent in exactly the way a working one is. Send known-bad
content through and confirm the activity fires before relying on it.

### Composing the layers

```csharp
services.AddRagNet(b => b
    .UseChunkSanitiser()        // ingest: strip injection patterns before embedding
    .UseQuerySanitiser()        // pre-retrieval: strip them from the query too (AskAsync only)
    .UseRetrievalGuard()        // retrieved chunks: redact what survived
    .UseTrustLevelGuard(o => o.DropUntrusted = true)
    .UsePromptHardening());     // answer: tell the model the content is data
```

Each is independent — register the layers you want. The LLM variants (`UseLlmChunkSanitiser`,
`UseLlmQuerySanitiser`) slot in beside their regex counterparts and require a registered
`IChatClient`.

## RBAC on Chunks

Role-based access control filters retrieved chunks based on an `allowed_roles` metadata key. Chunks that do not carry the key are world-readable and pass through for every caller.

### Tagging documents at ingest

Attach an `allowed_roles` entry in `DocumentMetadata.Tags` when ingesting a document. The value is a comma-separated, case-insensitive list of role names:

```csharp
await pipeline.IngestAsync(stream, new DocumentMetadata
{
    DocumentId = new DocumentId("hr-handbook-2024"),
    FileName   = "hr-handbook-2024.pdf",
    Tags       = new Dictionary<string, MetadataValue>
    {
        ["allowed_roles"] = "hr,finance",
    },
});
```

`MetadataBehavior` propagates all `Tags` entries into each chunk's metadata dictionary at ingest time. After ingestion every chunk produced from the document carries `allowed_roles = "hr,finance"` in its stored metadata.

Chunks from documents that have no `allowed_roles` tag are always returned, regardless of who is calling.

### `ICallerContext`

`RbacRetrievalGuard` resolves the caller's roles at retrieval time by calling `ICallerContext.GetRoles()`. The interface is framework-agnostic:

```csharp
public interface ICallerContext
{
    IReadOnlyList<string> GetRoles();
}
```

Implement it as a singleton. For non-web hosts (console, worker service, batch job) use `AsyncLocal<IReadOnlyList<string>>` to flow roles per logical call:

```csharp
public sealed class AsyncLocalCallerContext : ICallerContext
{
    private static readonly AsyncLocal<IReadOnlyList<string>> _roles = new();

    public static void SetRoles(IReadOnlyList<string> roles) =>
        _roles.Value = roles;

    public IReadOnlyList<string> GetRoles() =>
        _roles.Value ?? [];
}
```

Register it before calling `UseRbac()`:

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<ICallerContext, AsyncLocalCallerContext>();
services.AddRagNet(b => b.UseRbac());
```

### ASP.NET Core integration

The `Rag.NET.Security.AspNetCore` package provides `ClaimsPrincipalCallerContext`, which reads roles from the current `ClaimsPrincipal` via `IHttpContextAccessor`. Call `AddRagNetAspNetCoreSecurity()` after `AddRagNet`:

```csharp
services.AddRagNet(b => b.UseRbac());
services.AddRagNetAspNetCoreSecurity();
```

`AddRagNetAspNetCoreSecurity` also calls `AddHttpContextAccessor()`, so no separate registration is needed.

### Registration

```csharp
services.AddRagNet(b => b
    .UseRbac());
```

> **Note:** `UseRbac()` resolves `ICallerContext` as a required service. If no implementation is registered, the application will throw `InvalidOperationException` at first retrieval. Always register `ICallerContext` before the pipeline is first used — either via `AddRagNetAspNetCoreSecurity()` or a custom implementation.

## PII Detection and Redaction

PII detection protects stored embeddings by scrubbing personal data from chunk text at ingest time, before any data reaches the vector store. It is implemented by `IChunkSanitiser` and runs as part of the ingestion pipeline.

Two modes are available: regex-based and LLM-based. They can be registered independently or chained — multiple `IChunkSanitiser` registrations are applied in order.

### Regex detection (`UsePiiDetection`)

Uses compiled regular expressions to find and replace PII patterns. All built-in patterns are active by default:

```csharp
services.AddRagNet(b => b
    .UsePiiDetection());
```

#### Built-in patterns

| Pattern | Placeholder | Matches |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `PiiPatterns.Email` | `[EMAIL]` | RFC 5321 email addresses |
| `PiiPatterns.Phone` | `[PHONE]` | US phone numbers (various formats, optional country code) |
| `PiiPatterns.Ssn` | `[SSN]` | US Social Security numbers (`\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}`) |
| `PiiPatterns.CreditCard` | `[CREDIT_CARD]` | Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Amex card numbers |
| `PiiPatterns.IpAddress` | `[IP_ADDRESS]` | IPv4 and IPv6 addresses |

A chunk containing `"Contact john@example.com or call 555-867-5309"` becomes `"Contact [EMAIL] or call [PHONE]"`.

#### Configuring patterns

Add custom patterns or remove built-ins by configuring `PiiDetectionOptions`:

```csharp
services.AddRagNet(b => b
    .UsePiiDetection(o =>
    {
        // Remove SSN detection
        o.Patterns.Remove(PiiPatterns.Ssn);

        // Add a custom pattern — Dutch BSN number
        o.Patterns.Add(new PiiPattern
        {
            Placeholder  = "[BSN]",
            RegexPattern = @"\b\d{9}\b",
        });
    }));
```

`PiiDetectionOptions.Patterns` is pre-populated with `PiiPatterns.Defaults`. Any modification before `IChunkSanitiser` is constructed takes effect immediately — patterns are compiled once at construction time.

#### Timeout protection

Each regex is evaluated with a 1-second timeout. If a regex times out (pathological backtracking on a long chunk), the sanitiser logs a warning and returns the original text unchanged. Downstream processing is never blocked.

### LLM detection (`UseLlmPiiDetection`)

Asks a registered `IChatClient` to identify and redact PII. Covers patterns that are difficult to express as regular expressions (names, addresses, contextual identifiers):

```csharp
services.AddRagNet(b => b
    .UseLlmPiiDetection());
```

An `IChatClient` must be registered in DI before calling `UseLlmPiiDetection()`.

### Chaining regex and LLM detection

Register both to apply regex redaction first, then pass the partially-redacted text to the LLM:

```csharp
services.AddRagNet(b => b
    .UsePiiDetection()      // regex pass — fast, deterministic
    .UseLlmPiiDetection()); // LLM pass — catches names, addresses, context-dependent PII
```

Sanitisers are applied in registration order. The LLM sees already-redacted text, which reduces both cost and hallucination risk.

## Audit Log

The audit log captures every retrieval and answer event to a SQLite database. It is designed for compliance scenarios: who retrieved which chunks, when, and (optionally) what they asked.

### What is captured

**`AuditRetrievalEvent`** — written after every `RetrieveAsync` call:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `RequestId` | `string` | Shared with the corresponding `AuditAnswerEvent` |
| `Timestamp` | `DateTimeOffset` | UTC timestamp of the retrieval |
| `CallerRoles` | `IReadOnlyList<string>` | Roles from `ICallerContext`, or empty list when RBAC is not active |
| `Chunks` | `IReadOnlyList<AuditChunkRef>` | `DocumentId`, `ChunkIndex`, and `Score` for each returned chunk |
| `Query` | `string?` | Raw query text — only populated when `LogQueryText = true` |

**`AuditAnswerEvent`** — written after every `AskAsync` call:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `RequestId` | `string` | Matches the `RequestId` of the preceding `AuditRetrievalEvent` |
| `Timestamp` | `DateTimeOffset` | UTC timestamp of answer generation |
| `Answer` | `string?` | Generated answer text — only populated when `LogAnswerText = true` |

### Privacy defaults

By default neither the query text nor the answer text is stored:

```csharp
public sealed class AuditLogOptions
{
    public bool   LogQueryText  { get; set; } = false;
    public bool   LogAnswerText { get; set; } = false;
    public string DatabasePath  { get; set; } = "rag-audit.db";
}
```

Enable them explicitly when your compliance policy requires it:

```csharp
services.AddRagNet(b => b
    .UseSqliteAuditLog(o =>
    {
        o.LogQueryText  = true;
        o.LogAnswerText = true;
        o.DatabasePath  = "/var/data/audit.db";
    }));
```

### Correlation

`AuditRetrievalBehavior` generates a `RequestId` (a `Guid`) after retrieval and stores it in `AuditCorrelationContext`, which is an `AsyncLocal`-backed singleton. `AuditAnswerEngineDecorator` reads the same `RequestId` from `AuditCorrelationContext` when writing the answer event. No extra setup is required — the correlation is automatic for any call that goes through `AskAsync` (which calls retrieval then generation in sequence).

If you call `RetrieveAsync` and `AskAsync` independently (e.g., streaming scenarios), the `RequestId` flows correctly as long as both calls share the same async execution context.

### Registration

```csharp
services.AddRagNet(b => b
    .UseSqliteAuditLog(o =>
    {
        o.LogQueryText = true;
        o.DatabasePath = "/var/data/audit.db";
    }));
```

The SQLite database and tables are created lazily on the first write. Write failures are logged as warnings and never thrown — the pipeline continues normally even if the audit log is unavailable.

### SQLite tables

The audit database contains two tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE retrieval_events (
    id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    request_id   TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp    TEXT NOT NULL,   -- ISO 8601 UTC
    caller_roles TEXT NOT NULL,   -- JSON array of strings
    chunks       TEXT NOT NULL,   -- JSON array of {documentId, chunkIndex, score}
    query        TEXT             -- NULL unless LogQueryText = true
);

CREATE TABLE answer_events (
    id         INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    request_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp  TEXT NOT NULL,   -- ISO 8601 UTC
    answer     TEXT             -- NULL unless LogAnswerText = true
);
```

Query all retrieval events for a user role in the last 24 hours:

```sql
SELECT request_id, timestamp, caller_roles, chunks
FROM   retrieval_events
WHERE  json_each.value = 'hr'
  AND  timestamp >= datetime('now', '-1 day')
FROM   retrieval_events, json_each(caller_roles);
```

Join retrieval and answer events by `request_id`:

```sql
SELECT r.timestamp, r.caller_roles, r.query, a.answer
FROM   retrieval_events r
JOIN   answer_events    a ON a.request_id = r.request_id
ORDER  BY r.timestamp DESC
LIMIT  100;
```

## Composing Features

All three features are independent and compose freely. Register them in a single `AddRagNet` block:

```csharp
// ASP.NET Core — RBAC + PII redaction + audit log
services.AddRagNet(b => b
    .UseRbac()
    .UsePiiDetection(o =>
    {
        o.Patterns.Remove(PiiPatterns.Ssn); // not applicable for this corpus
    })
    .UseLlmPiiDetection()
    .UseSqliteAuditLog(o =>
    {
        o.LogQueryText = true;
        o.DatabasePath = "/var/data/audit.db";
    }));

services.AddRagNetAspNetCoreSecurity(); // wires ClaimsPrincipalCallerContext for UseRbac
```

The registration order within the builder determines sanitiser chain order (regex before LLM). RBAC filtering and audit logging are independent of registration order relative to PII.

Answer auditing is independent of registration order relative to the answer engines. `UseSqliteAuditLog` adds its decorator to the answer-engine decorations `RagPipeline` applies when it composes its engine, so `rag.UseSqliteAuditLog().UseMapReduceAnswerEngine()` and the reverse both audit every answer. Both used to register `IAnswerEngine` directly, so last-wins dropped whichever ran first — while retrieval auditing kept working, leaving an audit log that read as complete and recorded no answers at all ([#195](https://github.com/MarcelRoozekrans/Rag.NET/issues/195)). Resolving `IAnswerEngine` yields the *registered* engine, undecorated; `ComposedAnswerEngine` is the audited one.
