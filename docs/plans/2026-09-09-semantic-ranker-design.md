# Design: the semantic ranker, and the simulator that lies about it

**Issue:** #328 · **Phase:** 6.2.34 · **Date:** 2026-09-09

**Origin:** §4 of `docs/plans/2026-09-09-hybrid-score-scale-design.md`, approved as part 2 of 6.2.33
and split out on verifiability. **This document corrects three things in that section** — see §1.
Everything else there stands.

## 0. What is being built

@StefH asked (#328) for Azure AI Search's semantic ranker: a `SemanticSearch` configuration on the
index and `QueryType.Semantic` on the query, so the service reranks results with its own model. The
issue also asks for `KNearestNeighborsCount` to be settable. **That half is already shipped** —
6.2.5's #374 added `AzureAISearchOptions.KNearestNeighborsCount`, reachable through
`UseAzureAISearch(..., configure)` and validated eagerly. An earlier draft of this design said it
"becomes settable"; that was wrong, and reading the code rather than the issue is what caught it.

6.2.5 split the ranker off "pending the score-scale decision". 6.2.33 took that decision:
`IHybridSearchable.HybridScoreScale` now declares a fused path's scale, and the rule is that an
ordinal score is never thresholded. **The ranker is the third case of that rule**, not a new
question.

## 1. Three corrections to §4 of the 6.2.33 design

**§4 said the store "implements `IScoreScaleAware`" when the ranker is on and "does not implement
the interface at all" when off. That is not expressible in C#** — a class implements an interface or
it does not; the decision is compile-time.

**The store implements it unconditionally and returns a value fixed at construction:**
`OpaqueRanking` when the ranker is on, `Similarity` when off. This satisfies the interface's
"constant for the lifetime of the instance" contract exactly, and it is **behaviour-preserving when
off**: `PersistentConversationMemory` tests `is not IScoreScaleAware { ScoreScale: OpaqueRanking }`
(`:66`), so a store declaring `Similarity` and a store not implementing the interface take the same
branch. Nothing changes for anyone who does not opt in.

**§4 implied verification is wholly account-blocked. It is not, and the simulator's own defect is
why.** Measured 2026-09-09: the simulator accepts a semantic index configuration and
`queryType: semantic`, returns HTTP 200 with results, and returns **no `rerankerScore`**. That makes
it a *fixture for the guard*: requesting the ranker against the simulator must throw, and that is a
real local test of the thing most likely to be got wrong. What genuinely needs a resource is
narrower — see §5.

**§4 did not mention the index migration, and Azure turns out not to have the hazard Redis had.**
`InitializeAsync` calls `CreateOrUpdateIndexAsync` with a freshly built definition (`:87`), so an
existing index is **reconciled** to include the new semantic configuration on the next
initialisation. Contrast 6.2.31, where `RedisVectorStore.InitializeAsync` deliberately leaves an
existing index alone — because dropping it would discard every stored vector — and therefore needed
an `FT.INFO` guard. **No equivalent guard is needed here**, and the reason is worth writing down so
nobody adds one by analogy.

## 2. Shape

### 2.1 Opt-in, per instance

A constructor parameter, defaulted off, threaded through the three public constructors to the
private one. Per instance rather than per request **because it reshapes the score of the ordinary
`SearchAsync` path**, whose scale `IScoreScaleAware` requires to be constant for the instance's
lifetime. A per-request toggle would make that vary, and callers may cache the probe.

The semantic configuration's name is an implementation detail, not a knob: one configuration, named
by the store, built from the fields the store already defines.

### 2.2 The index gains a semantic configuration

`BuildIndex` adds a `SemanticSearch` with one `SemanticConfiguration` prioritising the `text` field
as content. Added **only when the ranker is enabled** — an index carrying a configuration nothing
uses is clutter, and adding it unconditionally would change every existing index on next
initialisation for no benefit.

### 2.3 The query asks for it

When enabled, `SearchAsync` sets `QueryType = SearchQueryType.Semantic` and
`SemanticSearch = new SemanticSearchOptions { SemanticConfigurationName = ... }`.

**Scope: the dense path only.** `HybridSearchAsync` is left alone. Combining the ranker with native
hybrid fusion is a second question about what score comes back from two rerankers stacked, and
answering it here would double the unverifiable surface.

### 2.4 The score

`SearchResult<T>.SemanticSearch.RerankerScore` is returned **as it comes**, and the store declares
`OpaqueRanking`. It is not rescaled from Azure's 0–4 into a [0,1] similarity: an invented similarity
is exactly what #56 was about, and `ScoreScale` exists so a store can say "ordinal" instead of
faking a number.

**`MinScore` is therefore not applied** when the ranker is on, for the same reason and by the same
rule as 6.2.33's hybrid path.

### 2.5 The guard

**When the ranker is enabled and a result carries no `RerankerScore`, throw**, naming the index and
saying the service did not perform semantic ranking.

This is the whole reason the feature can be shipped honestly. The simulator returns HTTP 200 with
results and no reranker score; a real service will do the same if the tier does not include semantic
ranking, if the region does not support it, or if the configuration name does not match. **Every one
of those is a silent downgrade to ordinary scoring** — the caller gets plausible results, ranked the
old way, believing they were reranked. The guard converts all of them into one loud failure.

### 2.6 `k` and the ranker interact, and the option's own remarks already say how

`KNearestNeighborsCount` is already settable, so nothing is added there. What is added is a **guard
on the combination**, because the two settings interact in a documented way that fails quietly.

That option's remarks already quote Microsoft: *"Whenever you use semantic ranking with vectors, set
`k` to 50. Semantic ranker uses up to 50 matches as input. Specifying less than 50 deprives the
semantic ranking models of necessary inputs."* They end by noting semantic ranking is not
implemented here yet and that the advice is for anyone configuring the index themselves. **This
phase is when that stops being hypothetical.**

So **enabling the ranker with `KNearestNeighborsCount` set below 50 is rejected at registration**,
in `ValidateConfigured`, beside the existing `k < 1` check. Leaving it `null` stays valid and
remains the right default — omitting the parameter is what makes Azure apply its own 50.

**Rejected rather than warned, unlike §2.4's `MinScore` decision**, and the difference is the point:
`MinScore` arrives on shared per-request options that a caller may have set for an entirely
different path, so throwing would punish an innocent configuration. `k` and the ranker are both
deliberate, set on the same options object, at registration, by the same person. Nobody combines
them by accident — and the damage is invisible: worse ranking, no error.

The option's remarks are updated to say the guard exists rather than that the feature does not.

## 3. What is deliberately not in scope

- **Semantic ranking on the hybrid path** (§2.3).
- **Semantic captions, answers, or highlights.** #328 does not ask for them and each is its own
  response shape.
- **Rescaling the reranker score.** §2.4.
- **A tier or region probe.** The guard catches the consequence without the store having to model
  Azure's SKU matrix.

## 4. How it will be proved

Locally, against the simulator and without any account:

| claim | test |
| --- | --- |
| the guard fires when the service does not rerank | enable the ranker, search, assert the throw — **the simulator produces this condition naturally** |
| the index gains a semantic configuration when enabled | read the index definition back and assert it |
| the index has none when disabled | same, asserting absence |
| the store declares `OpaqueRanking` when enabled | property assertion |
| the store declares `Similarity` when disabled | property assertion — pins the behaviour-preserving default |
| enabling the ranker with `k` below 50 is rejected at registration | `UseAzureAISearch` with both set, assert the throw names both |
| enabling the ranker with `k` null or at least 50 is accepted | the same, asserting no throw |
| the dense path is unchanged when the ranker is off | the existing suite, which must stay green |

**Mutation-checked**, including the two that matter most: delete the guard (the enabled-path test
must go red) and flip the declared scale (the property tests must go red).

## 5. What cannot be verified without a resource, stated precisely

**This section originally understated the gap, and the mutation sweep is what corrected it.**
Mutating `ExecuteSearchAsync` to apply `MinScore` on the ranked path — inserted immediately after
the guard's throw — survived the sweep, and not because a test is missing. The line is
**unreachable in any local test**: the guard fires whenever `RerankerScore` is null, the simulator
never returns one, so the code that runs *after* the guard's throw, on the branch the guard
protects, can never execute against it.

**That makes the unverifiable surface broader than "one claim".** It is not only "Azure's ranker
populates `RerankerScore` and reorders results" — it is **everything downstream of the guard**:
which value gets assigned to `Score` when a `RerankerScore` is actually present, and that
`MinScore` is correctly skipped on that path, are equally unreachable locally, for the same
reason. The guard that makes the feature safe to ship — throw rather than silently hand back a
downgraded result — is exactly what stands between every local test and the code beyond it.

**What is tested locally is real, and this correction does not diminish it.** The option, the `k`
guard and its boundary at 50, the semantic configuration appearing on the index when enabled and
absent when it is not, both declared score scales, and — the most important seam — that the guard
itself throws when the service accepts the request and returns no reranker score: all of that is
genuine local coverage, mutation-checked, against a simulator whose defect (HTTP 200, ordinary
results, no `rerankerScore`) is exactly the shape a real under-provisioned service takes.

`<VerifiedByReason>` should say that the guard's throw path is verified locally, and that
everything past it — the score it would assign, and whether Azure's ranker genuinely reorders
results — is not, and needs a resource: Basic tier or higher, billable, region-limited.

**The honest position, unchanged, and it is the part that is fully kept:** if the service silently
does not rank, this code throws rather than publishing a number it cannot describe. The narrower
promise — that when the service *does* rank, the number it publishes is the right one — is what
this section was too optimistic about, and it is not kept without a resource.

## 6. Consequences

**Additive and off by default.** No existing caller's behaviour changes: the constructor parameter
defaults off, the index gains nothing, the query is unchanged, and the declared scale is
`Similarity`, which is the same branch every consumer already took.

**Opting in is a deliberate trade**: better ranking from the service, in exchange for a score that
can only be ordered and not thresholded — declared, not hidden.

**The public API grows**: one option, one constructor parameter and one interface implementation on
`AzureAISearchVectorStore`. Pre-1.0, and cheaper now than after.

**One configuration becomes invalid**: the ranker enabled together with an explicit `k` below 50.
Nobody can be in that state today, because the ranker does not exist yet.
