/**
 * Every published page belongs to exactly one category here.
 *
 * Docusaurus generates a route for any file under `docs/` whether or not the sidebar names it, so
 * a page left out of this file is built, deployed and reachable by URL while being invisible to
 * anyone browsing. Thirteen pages were in that state — 4,751 of the site's 17,500 lines, including
 * the whole of RAPTOR, GraphRAG, security, resilience, conversational memory and every SaaS
 * connector. `guide/raptor` and `guide/graphrag` had no inbound link from any listed page either,
 * so browsing could not reach them at all.
 *
 * `DocumentationSidebarTests` fails the build if a page under `docs/` is ever again missing from
 * this file, because "the sidebar is complete" is not a property a green docs build can observe:
 * the site builds clean either way. Excluded trees (`plans/`, `planning/`, `pre-push-review-*`)
 * are declared in `docusaurus.config.ts` and the guard reads them from there rather than keeping
 * its own copy.
